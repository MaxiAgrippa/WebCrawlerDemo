Bonnie Burton November 24, 2014 9:12 PM PST The new Wonder Woman movie stars Gal Gadot.

She's best known for her role as a director and executive producer for the award-winning and groundbreaking TV show "Breaking Bad." MacLaren also directed and served as executive producer on multiple episodes of "The X-Files." This will mark for first time in a long while a woman has had the opportunity to direct a mainstream comic book movie. According to The Hollywood Reporter, "Sources say there was pressure from within to hire a woman for the job as the character has such a strong association with the notion of female empowerment." In addition to MacLaren, "the studio did meet with several women directors -- Jennifer Kent, the director of the well-regarded female-centric horror film "The Babadook," was one -- while Lesli Linka Glatter, a director and co-executive producer on "Homeland," was also on the list." Zack Snyder, Deborah Snyder and Charles Roven are producing the Wonder Woman movie, which will hit theaters in 2017. Before we see the Amazonian superhero in action in her own movie, Gadot will debut her role as Wonder Woman in the upcoming film "Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice" out in 2016, directed by Zack Snyder.
