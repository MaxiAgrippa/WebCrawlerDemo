Nicole Lee November 2, 2007 12:32 PM PDT The Wall Street Journal reports that Google will make a big announcement on Monday that will detail the company's partnerships with various handset makers and carriers for its much-ballyhooed "open" mobile OS. Apparently U.S. carriers T-Mobile and Sprint are slated to be in on it, while Taiwan's HTC is a safe bet for a handset manufacturer. Other manufacturers are also possible (Samsung, LG , and Sony Ericsson, to name a few), but we won't know until Monday. As we've previously theorized, these Google-powered phones could have a Linux-based OS, along with a few Google-branded software applications. News.com has attempted to confirm this report, and both Google and T-Mobile have replied "no comment" to the speculation.
