When it comes to iPhone cases, there are basically three camps: The outsiders who prefer naked iPhones and don't fear drops on cold, hard concrete Those who like soft rubber/silicone iPhone cases Those who like hard cases. I've been a fan of the soft case. The first generation of iPhone 3G hard cases seemed too bulky, full of seams, odd angles ... and downright ugly. But every now and then, I catch sight of a case that seems slimmer, less plasticky, and I pause. Is it even possible for a soft case guy to switch to a hard case? It's a highly personal issue, and it can be somewhat embarrassing. I mean, who hasn't noticed someone else's weird case and quietly judged their taste? In the interest of non-Pulitzer journalism, I'll let you in on my most recent case thoughts -- because hey, it just might help someone who's teetering on the hard/soft fence. Shiny Things After the shiny mirrored finish on the Griffin Reflect case for the iPhone 3G caught my eye, I decided -- full of skepticism -- to give it a try. Griffin Technology was kind enough to send along three cases for me to review -- the aforementioned Reflect as well as its iClear and NuForm models. Until this test, I was using Marware's Sport Grip for iPhone 3G. It's black, thick enough to provide some cushion but thin enough to retain the elegant shape of the iPhone. Plus it has ample coverage on the top and bottom front area, which keeps the screen above surfaces if you happen to set it face down. Basically, I like it. Most cases, soft and hard, mess with the ability to easily dock an iPhone. Often the bottom of the case is too thick. Some hard cases have gotten around the problem by creating an easily removable base. Griffin's Nu Form hard-shell case is designed for easy docking. It has a two-piece shatter-proof polycarbonate shell, as well as a rigid screen protector and a cleaning cloth for prepping your iPhone 3G. You don't want any pocket lint or debris getting stuck between the body and the protection. When the Nu Form isn't snapped snug around the iPhone, it basically falls apart. But don't worry, once you slide the top portion over the iPhone, carefully placing the screen protector in place (there's no adhesive), the bottom slides on and stays put. Somehow, Griffin engineered the size and shape to grab and hold, yet still let the bottom pop off fast when you want to dock the iPhone. Cool. The downside for me was the tolerances -- I find tiny gaps where plastic comes together oddly irritating. I'm no Steve Jobs, but I appreciate things that fit perfectly, and while covering my iPhone with any case is blasphemous enough, the case needs to have darn near rocket-science alignment. Plus, there are tiny seams where the plastic had been molded together. I don't like that. It's not bad, and it's barely noticeable, but I noticed anyway. To toss in an insult, the little circle cut out for the camera lens didn't allow the lens to be exactly centered in the case cutout. Arrgh. Griffin's fault? Apple's fault? My fault upon installation? Who knows. Some people might never notice, but I did. The Nu Form Verdict: The the easy docking feature wasn't compelling enough for me to switch -- even though the case is serviceable and functions as advertised. Griffin also makes a hard-shell leather version for those who happen to be into leather on electronics. Trying Again Next up, I tried the iClear and Reflect. Both cases are remarkably similar, coming from what appears to be the same basic mold. You get a rear base plate that curves up halfway to meet a top polycarbonate ring for the front of the iPhone. The entire face of the iPhone, including the button and speaker, is free from a shell covering. Just the rim is protected by the case. (FYI, the previous-generation iClear from Griffin had the shell cover the four corners of the iPhone face, which offered more protection but turned the elegant iPhone into just another device.) Both the iClear and the Reflect come with a static-peel screen protector. I didn't bother installing it because I already have a thin clear screen protector. For those who don't have one, get one. Use it. Tell your friends. Back to the iClear. The rear portion is a translucent white -- kind of like a shower door. I imagine it would look great on a white iPhone 3G. On the black iPhone 3G I have, it's not bad. More importantly, it lets the Apple logo show through to good effect. The top ring is clear. And it's not really a ring -- it's rectangular. But anyway, to install, simply place the iPhone in the bottom and snap the top over it. It's easy and freakishly sturdy. There are cutouts for the top and bottom controls, the volume control and the camera, which was closer to center. I tried to pull it apart. Since I'm not about to test the strength of a case by dropping my iPhone on concrete, I thought I might have to break it to remove the handset. Then I noticed a small notch at the bottom corner. Insert a coin and twist, and the two halves will come apart. Nice. The iClear Verdict: It's good. Snug. Good lines and no plasticky seams to irritate me. But the whitish back put me off -- I bought the black model iPhone for a reason -- and the case was almost as slippery as the iPhone itself. I was afraid it might slip out of the pocket of a pair of cargo shorts. Not a winner for me. More Reflections The Reflect, on the other hand, has all the same benefits as the iClear, plus a few more. First, the shiny mirrored finish on the ring looks good. Second, the back is a darkly translucent black -- which also lets the Apple logo show through. Third, the rear portion of the case also has a matte black rubberized finish. It's subtle -- far less "rubber"-feeling than a silicon case, but it's still there. Very nice. And there's just enough grip to give me hope that it would keep my iPhone 3G in my pocket as I reclined in a seat at a movie theater -- while wearing cargo shorts -- and maybe even if I rested a foot on top of the seat in front of me. (Yeah, I'm kind of a rebel.) The Reflect Verdict: Let's put it this way -- it's been on my iPhone 3G for a few days now. I'm unsure if or when I'll take it off. The test, though, certainly gives me hope. I think it's definitively possible for a soft-case fan to switch to a hard case. And while I am partial to the Griffin Reflect, there are a lot of other quality accessory manufacturers who are also refining their cases. Here's a handful that I think are also worth checking out, if you're so inclined: Agent 18 ClearShield for iPhone 3G Case-mate Color Naked Cases for iPhone 3G Contour Flick iPhone 3G DLO HybridShell for iPhone 3G Incase Slider Case Marware Flexi-Shell for iPhone 3G OtterBox for iPhone 3G Defender Series Speck SeeThru Hard Shell Case and Stand for iPhone 3G Get Permission to License or Reproduce this Article Print Email Reprints More by Chris Maxcer Reader Comments Join the discussion! Re: iPhone 3G's Best Case Scenario iPhoneCase Posted 2016-10-17 I read through this article completely on the topic of the resemblance of latest and previous technologies, its a remarkable article. Reply iPhone cases iphonecases Posted 2011-06-03 I have tried out several different types of iPhone cases myself. Similar to your findings, there are good and bad points that come along with the cases, no matter the material the case is made. To answer Chris's question above, it is possible to make the switch. I used to use a soft iPhone case and switched to a hard case. The only thing I don't like about the hard case is if I drop the phone on its face. With the soft, rubbery case, the phone face was slightly protected, but with the hard case it really isn't.
