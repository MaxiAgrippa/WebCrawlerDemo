Tom Krazit November 15, 2006 3:38 PM PST A Chinese newspaper reported Wednesday that Apple has awarded a contract to build the elusive iPhone to Hon Hai, a contract manufacturer based in Taiwan. The Commercial Times says Apple has ordered 12 million iPhones from Hon Hai, also known as Foxconn, with an eye on a first-half 2007 unveiling. It was hard to find a direct link to the Commercial Times story, but outfits like Bloomberg and Forbes picked up the story, as did a host of the usual bloggers and enthusiasts. for months--if not years--about the iPhone, which would be Apple's take on the smart phone/music player/do-it-all-and-in-style device. The Appleites have been pointing toward a MacWorld introduction for the device, but now some are saying early January might be too early for a widespread rollout, and that Apple CEO Steve Jobs might just announce the product at MacWorld. Apple tends not to announce products before they are available, but it broke with tradition earlier this year when it discussed its iTV product during the launch of the movie section of the iTunes store.
