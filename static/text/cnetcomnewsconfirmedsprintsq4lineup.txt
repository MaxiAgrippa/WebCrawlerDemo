Bonnie Cha September 11, 2007 1:48 PM PDT Engadget Mobile Ooooweee--those are some pretty enticing photos. It seems Engadget Mobile got its hands on some marketing material from Sprint about the carrier's upcoming portfolio of smart phones and cell phones for Q4, and if true, we think a lot of Sprint customers will be pleased by it. On tap, we've got the HTC Touch with its innovative touch screen; the RIM BlackBerry Pearl 8130 (aka BlackBerry Pearl 2), rocking EV-DO and GPS; the Palm Centro, the company's slimmest smart phone with EV-DO support; and finally, the LG Rumor, a slide-out QWERTY device with a focus on social networking sites like Facebook and MySpace. All handsets are slated for a Q4 release but there has been no official confirmation or pricing details from Sprint. Update: OK, we just got confirmation from Sprint that these mobiles will indeed be coming to a store near you by the end of the year. Woohoo! Pricing, however, was not revealed at this time.
