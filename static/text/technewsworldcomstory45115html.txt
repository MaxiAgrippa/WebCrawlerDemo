Yahoo today announced agreements with both CNN.com and ABC News in which both news organizations will provide daily video news feeds to Yahoo News starting next month. CNN.com will offer extensive video clips daily and ABC News will offer a robust package of on demand video content. All of the video will be available for free to Yahoo users, and will be supported by advertising. The video from ABC News and CNN.com will be integrated throughout Yahoo News, including on its front page, within story pages, and in other special sections of the site, such as full coverage packages, on which Yahoo News editors bring together news content from across the Internet. It will also be made available to Yahoo's broadband service subscribers through its co-branded relationships with SBC Communications, Rogers Cable, BT and Verizon Communications. More Use of Video "The addition of CNN.com and ABC News video to Yahoo brings two of the world's most respected and valuable news providers to the Internet's largest audience," Scott Moore, vice president of content operations for Yahoo, said. "Video content is becoming an increasingly important component of the online news experience for Yahoo News users, and these relationships are an important step in expanding the video content on our site." Under terms of the agreement, CNN.com will offer extensive daily video content, including breaking U.S. and world news in the categories of politics, business, technology and more. "This agreement gives us another opportunity to extend our brand and expand CNN's online audience," said Susan Grant, executive vice president of CNN News Services. Wide Range of Topics ABC News will deliver a wide range of video to Yahoo users covering the top news stories of the day as well as entertainment and politics. The relationship will make Yahoo one of the first providers of free on demand video from ABC News. The content from ABC News extends a long-standing distribution arrangement between the two organizations, which provides ABC News' premium video products and ABC News Now to SBC Yahoo's broadband service subscribers. Yahoo News is the largest independent news and information site on the Web. It offers consumers news from more than 100 news outlets, and a News Search tool that searches more than 8,000 news sources.

The damage to the global economy would be incalculable. Many people would not be able to communicate with loved ones and friends. It would make working from home impossible. Loss of entertainment options could threaten mental health.
