Infrastructure Wireless & IoT VMware acquires Nyansa to improve SD-WAN capabilities Alex Coop @ItsJustAlexCoop Published: January 22nd, 2020 VMware’s appetite for acquisitions hasn’t waned since it acquired Pivotal last summer for $2.7 billion, and this week announced its intention to buy network analytics software provider Nyansa. For an undisclosed sum, VMware indicated Jan. 21 to acquire Nyansa to bolster its network visibility and monitoring capabilities by combining VMware SD-WAN by VeloCloud with Nyansa’s cloud-based AIOps platform.

Abe Ankumah, chief executive officer and co-founder of Nyansa, wrote in a separate blog post that Nyansa Voyance will extend the VMware portfolio further into the enterprise campus and branch by adding software capabilities on Wi-Fi and LAN devices, as well as analytics tools to the VMware data centre portfolio. The two companies, added Ankumah, are aligned on more than just the technologies involved in this strategy. “Over the years at Nyansa, we’ve obsessed about building a customer-first, radically candid, and openly communicative culture that facilitates innovation and learning. In all our interactions thus far, the VMware team has embodied similar values that will allow the Nyansa team to continue to thrive, while also leveraging the resources and scale of VMware,” he wrote. The deal is expected to close between February and March.
