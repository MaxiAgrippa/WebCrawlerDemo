Here's a full list. Kent German May 6, 2009 5:35 PM PDT I have to admit that during the past year I've been gloating to my CNET Asia colleagues over the iPhone. I just had to savor the fact that at long last the United States got a hot tech gadget before they did. At least with high-end cell phones, that almost never happens. But in just a few weeks my bragging days will be over. On July 11, the new iPhone 3G lands not only in the United States with AT&T , but also in 21 19 other countries. In his WWDC keynote address, Apple CEO Steve Jobs included France and Belgium in the initial release list, but Orange has confirmed that French customers will have to wait until July 17. And across the border, Belgium's Mobistar has yet to set a date. Then, later this year, Apple will ship to an additional 48 nations in every continent except Antarctica. That's 70 countries, kids--a far cry from the six nations in which the current iPhone is available today. Interestingly, countries such as Australia and Italy will have two supporting carriers. Mainland China and Russia are two big places missing from the list, along with Taiwan, Korea, most of Southeast Asia, and almost the entire Middle East. So for those who missed the rapid-fire map shown during the at the keynote, here's a full list with supporting carriers.
