Not to be outdone, Michael Dell is signing a special line of his namesake laptops that feature an exclusive World of Warcraft theme, according to Laptoping. But unlike so many other so-called special editions, this one is truly limited--to only two, both for sale now on eBay. "The custom-painted Burning Crusade Edition features (artist Mike) Lavalle's airbrushed re-creation of original composition from the new World of Warcraft expansion," according to the eBay listing. The XPS M1710 gaming laptop also has a 17-inch screen, 2.33GHz Intel Core Duo chip, 2GB memory, 100GB hard drive and DVD burner. Those specs alone may not merit the bids as of this writing--$4,400 and $4,200--but they're for a good cause. The proceeds will go to the America's Second Harvest charity.
