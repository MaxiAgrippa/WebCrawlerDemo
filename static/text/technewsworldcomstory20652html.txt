Bernstein • CRM Buyer • ECT News Network Feb 3, 2003 11:44 AM PT 2020 online shopping habits and retailer strategies For the fourth year in a row, Episerver has surveyed over 4,000 global online shoppers to learn about their ecommerce expectations and habits. Download Reimagining Commerce now to get an exclusive look at successful retail strategies in 2020. KnowledgeBase Solutions is jockeying for position in an emerging market with the release this month of version 3.0 of its Web-based self-help and knowledge-management suite. Contenders in this arena need to address such pain points as ease of use, maintenance and improved integration between CRM and case-management applications, as well as portal integration and batch-import functions. The upgrade puts KnowledgeBase Solutions in shape to continue competing in a sector likely to undergo consolidation in the next few years as the market matures, said Timothy Hickernell, senior program director of Web and collaboration strategies at Meta Group. The knowledgebase segment is populated by 10 to 15 vendors -- none of which dominates -- providing fertile ground for realignment, he told CRM Buyer Magazine. Hosted or On-Site KnowledgeBase.net 3.0 combines document and knowledge management with advanced portal and search technology for a competitive price, James Segil, president and chief operating officer, told CRM Buyer. Designed to make building, maintaining and using a real-time knowledge base easier, KnowledgeBase.net 3.0's new features include personalized portals, back-end multilanguage searching, dynamic portal caching, portal snap-ins and extended APIs. KnowledgeBase.net can be used as a stand-alone tool or integrated into other CRM suites. Applications include self-service customer support, a help desk knowledge base, FAQ management, document management and contact-center knowledge management. As with the previous generation, hosted and on-site versions will be available for KnowledgeBase 3.0. Small to Mid-Size The hosted edition, starting at about US$200 per month, is managed and maintained at KnowledgeBase.net's data center. The only customer resources needed are a Web browser and an Internet connection to manage the application. Benefits include quick setup and knowledge base access. This edition is aimed at small and mid-size companies or those that do not want to incur the expenses necessary to support an on-site software application. The professional edition, at $4,999 to $9,995, is a packaged product intended to give clients the freedom to install and deploy software on location while selecting their own hardware to support the application. This edition is suitable for mid-size companies that do not want to outsource mission-critical data but need an affordable solution, the company said. It is designed with security in mind and can easily reside behind corporate firewalls. The modular design of the professional edition allows customers to make certain portals and information available to the public, while protecting the rest of the application. Targets Fortune 1000 Too The enterprise edition, starting at $50,000, is for full on-site deployment and enables the client to customize the offering. This edition is aimed at mission-critical and large-document-volume applications. It is designed for large call centers, contact centers and Fortune 1000 corporations. Some of the new features will be sold as separate modules. The multilanguage module, including 10 languages, will cost an additional $10,000 with the enterprise edition. The module will be standard on the hosted Edition but will be unavailable on the professional edition. The API module, available only with the enterprise edition, costs $7,500.

Small businesses can benefit phil_ayres Posted 2009-09-01 I agree with John that for small businesses, or any businesses in fact, one of the biggest obstacles to improving processes is attitude. Its not only a traditional mindset of "we've always done it this way", its also a time issue. Most businesses are up to their eyes in running the business and doing the work that has to be done that they don't have time to think about how to do things better. It is the time issue alone that can make an investment in a consultant with proven process improvement experience worth every penny. A good consultant can work with people without having to consume hours of their time. If they are also experts in the implementation of a specific BPM tool, they can guide the solution to the strengths of the product and avoid common pitfalls, so that the ...
