Privacy & Security Cyber Security Today: How to keep spam from filling your inbox Howard Solomon @HowardITWC Published: August 31st, 2018 Three tips for keeping spam out of your inbox from Canada’s privacy commissioner. Let’s talk about a four-letter word: Spam. Security companies and police are getting better at shutting down sources of fraud and theft-related spam, but there’s still lots coming into your inbox. The Anti-Phishing Working Group estimated that in March there were almost 114,000 unique phishing Web sites. So what can you do? First, you can report it to the CRTC’s Spam Reporting Centre at “fightspam.gc.ca.” Last month the commission fined two companies a total of $250,000 helping spread malware through online advertising. It also helps if you read your email slowly and think about what you’re responding to. If it looks too good to be true, it is. Messages claiming that you’ve won big money if you only answer a few personal questions are usually phony. Ignore messages from banks asking you to click on link and fill in your password. Reputable businesses never send you e-mails that ask you to verify your personal or financial information online. And, I know I’m repeating myself, but think carefully before clicking on a link sent by someone, even if it seems to be from someone you know like your boss, a co-worker, a family member or a friend. Their email could have been taken over by a crook, who’s sending out spam. For more on fighting spam, see the website of the office of the privacy commissioner of Canada.
