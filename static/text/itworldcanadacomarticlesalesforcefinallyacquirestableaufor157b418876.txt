Big Data & Analytics Salesforce finally acquires Tableau for $15.7B Alex Coop @ItsJustAlexCoop Published: June 10th, 2019 How Salesforce integrates Tableau into core cloud platforms will be key, says Nintex CMO After reports hinting at Salesforce’s strong desire to acquire Seattle company Tableau, it finally did for $15.7 billion USD in an all-stock deal. It’s the largest acquisition in the history of the company, Salesforce announced today. It comes on the heels of another major acquisition in the data visualization space; this one from Google. Last week Google announced its biggest acquisition since it bought home automation company Nest for $3.2 billion USD in 2014 by announcing the acquisition of data management firm Looker for $2.6 billion USD. Clearly, making sense of the sea of data generated by today’s organizations is top of mind for many. Salesforce can now extend its data intelligence for its existing customers and give customers a strong reason to pick them over Microsoft, according to Dustin Grosse, chief marketing and strategy officer for Nintex. A handful of Canadian data management firms partner with the Seattle-based company. “Microsoft has a strong Power Platform that includes Power BI, but eventually having analytics/visualization more natively embedded within Salesforce CRM offers tremendous potential value and convenience to sellers, marketers, and general managers,” he wrote in an email. But several questions about the acquisition remain. “It will be interesting to see how Salesforce eventually integrates Tableau into their core cloud platforms and connects it to other sales, marketing, and customer success tools,” indicated Grosse. “I’m also curious to see how Salesforce provides licensing options for business leaders and operators that want access to analytics and insights.” Related Download Sponsor: IBM Digital Reinvention in action: What to do and how to make it happen Register Now Big Data & Analytics Microsoft, Salesforce, tableau National Research Council opens cybersecurity research hub at University of New Brunswick Cisco Live Day 1: Major announcements around IoT and multi-domain integrations About Alex Coop Editorial director for IT World Canada and its sister publications, and former community reporter.
