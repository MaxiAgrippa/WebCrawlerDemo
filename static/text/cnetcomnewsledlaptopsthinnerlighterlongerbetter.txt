Instead of the regular fluorescent lamps that serve as backlights for your typical LCD screen, the new displays will use LEDs. The Tech Report's story mentions that the effect will be a brighter image with better contrast. What it doesn't mention is that LED-backlit displays will allow for thinner laptop designs and longer battery life. Apple and HP may be readying their designs, but Sony is already selling such a laptop. The Sony VAIO VGN-TXN15P/W is the first laptop we've seen with an LED-backlit display (we know of no others). Not only was the ultraportable's screen incredibly bright, but the VAIO TX was also one of the thinnest laptops we've ever reviewed. And it shattered CNET Labs' battery life record, lasting 9 hours and 42 minutes. Granted, its Core Solo processor is very efficient, but we believe the new LED backlights were the chief reason for it running for nearly 10 (10!) hours on a single charge. We're all for thinner, lighter laptops with brighter screens, but the best news surrounding this development is getting a full day's work done without hunting for a wall outlet.
