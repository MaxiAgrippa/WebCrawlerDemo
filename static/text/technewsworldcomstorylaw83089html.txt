Watch Now » Through an eleventh-hour maneuver, the United States and the European Union last week avoided action that could have choked the movement of data between the regions and caused financial harm to U.S. companies. It may be only a temporary respite, however. The problem stems from a European Court of Justice decision in October that blew up an agreement between the regions that provided more than 4,000 U.S. companies with a "safe harbor" from strict European privacy laws when handling the information of the region's citizens. The pact, called the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, agreed to by both regions, includes the following provisions: Strong obligations on how Europeans' personal data is handled and individual rights are guaranteed. The U.S. Commerce Department will monitor compliance with the obligations, and the Federal Trade Commission provide enforcement. A promise that access by U.S. law enforcement and national security agencies to Europeans' personal data will be subject to clear limitations, safeguards and oversight mechanisms. Establishment of several forms of redress for Europeans who believe their data has been misused. Enforcement Uncertainty The agreement aired last week is just a "draft." Details will be worked out over the next two months. During that time -- and very likely beyond it -- uncertainty will persist. "Uncertainty remains about the contents of the final wording of Privacy Shield and whether or not Privacy Shield will be approved by all EU member states," said Neil Stelzer, general counsel for Identity Finder. Meanwhile, the Article 29 Working Party -- the group within the European Union that's charged with protecting the processing and movement of the personal information of EU citizens -- has said it will hold off on enforcement actions until Privacy Shield is finalized. "However, data protection authorities in each EU country may still bring enforcement actions if a company was transferring data under [the original] Safe Harbor and continues to without another legal method," Stelzer told TechNewsWorld. "Whether or not they will is unknown," he added. Kicking Can Down the Road Although Privacy Shield has received kudos in many quarters, it appears to be a stopgap measure intended to buy more time for EU and U.S. negotiators. "They had to rush the announcement so that European authorities didn't start enforcement actions after the Jan. 31 deadline," said Aytekin Tank, CEO of JotForm. As the deadline to create a new Safe Harbor approached, European authorities may have realized that their high court had placed them in an untenable position. "Enforcement action on the scale required would be totally overwhelming for the national data protection authorities," said Stuart Buglass, an international business expert at Radius who advises high-tech multinationals on regulations and compliance for overseas data protection and privacy. "A prolonged moratorium was inevitable. The announcement on the Privacy Shield provided a reason for doing so," he told TechNewsWorld. "The draft agreement seems to be a kick-the-can method of buying time," Identity Finder's Stelzer added. Legal Tempest Ahead Even after Privacy Shield is finalized, its fate could be the same as its predecessor. "I'd put my money on the agreement getting tossed by the European courts," JotForm's Tank told TechNewsWorld. "The first agreement was tossed because the EU didn't trust European personal data with the U.S. government. This new agreement is no different," he noted. Without a final document in hand, it's difficult to predict Privacy Shield's legal prospects, said Yorgen Edholm, CEO of Accellion. "If history is any indicator, it's only a matter of time until Privacy Shield is challenged in the courts," he told TechNewsWorld. "Max Schrems, who brought down Safe Harbor, has already expressed doubt regarding the new framework's potential effectiveness," Edholm continued. "And without any commitment from the U.S. government to soften certain provisions of the Patriot Act, it is very unlikely Privacy Shield will be acceptable to European privacy advocates." Surveillance Reform Needed Privacy Shield alone likely won't satisfy Europe's high court. "Unless there is significant legal reform of the surveillance rights of U.S. government departments, then U.S. law will continue to fall short of EU data privacy standards and any data transfers will be unlawful," Radius' Buglass said. "The issue with the agreement is that it simply provides a complaint mechanism for EU citizens to seek redress for a privacy breach rather than prevent the breach occurring in the first place through significant reform of the U.S. surveillance laws," he added. Both the U.S. and Europe need to get their intelligence houses in order if Privacy Shield is going to work, noted Jens-Henrik Jeppesen, director of European affairs for the Center for Democracy & Technology. "The U.S. Congress should move swiftly to reform FISA Section 702, and EU member states should also narrow their surveillance laws and practices to be more aligned with international human rights norms," he said in a statement. FISA Section 702 is the law the National Security Agency used to justify its mass collection of phone calls and emails by directly tapping into the physical infrastructure of communications providers. Breach Diary Jan. 29. Landry's and Golden Nugget Hotels and Casinos releases list of facilities affected by three data breaches between May 4, 2014, and May 4, 2015.
