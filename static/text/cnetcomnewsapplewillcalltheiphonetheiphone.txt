The iPhone trademark dispute is finally over and now both companies can use the name, which means no more bickering. So we'll continue to see the Linksys iPhone and Apple will call their phone the iPhone too. Call me cynical, but I can't help thinking this was a very good exercise in PR that Apple saw coming right from the beginning. It went ahead and called it the iPhone without asking Cisco so the lawsuit story would give it ongoing media coverage. I can't wait to see what other lawsuits and controversial press coverage turns up on the way to the iPhone's official UK launch at the end of this year.
