Additionally, Sony says it has sold 104 million PS4 units, which makes it the second best-selling game console in history behind the PS2. (The PS2 has a lifetime sales record of 158 million units, making it highly likely that the PS4 won’t catch up before the PS5 launches.) The logo looks exactly as expected, with Sony once again following in the footsteps of the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4’s logos for the PS5. The only real difference here is the number. The font is the same, and there are no additional design flourishes going on. Image: Sony Details about the PlayStation 5 have been slowly trickling out over the past few months as Sony gears up to launch its next-generation console later this year. There’s still no word as to what the console looks like, unlike the competing Xbox Series X that Microsoft showed off for the first time last month at The Game Awards. But Sony has said the PS5 will support 8K graphics, ray tracing, super-fast SSDs to cut down on load times, and PS4 backwards compatibility. On the hardware front, expect an eight-core CPU (based on AMD’s new Zen 2 architecture) and a custom GPU based on AMD’s Radeon Navi hardware. We also know a few details about the PlayStation 5 controller, which will swap the current rumble technology for haptic feedback tech and feature “adaptive triggers” that can adjust how much resistance there is when you press them. Sony is expected to reveal more about the PlayStation 5 later this year, presumably during the E3 expo in Los Angeles in June.
