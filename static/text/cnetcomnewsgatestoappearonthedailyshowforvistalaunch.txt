News of the interview was confirmed by Tony Fox, the executive vice president for Comedy Central. "He sure is!" said Fox, when asked if Bill Gates would be appearing on the program and talking about Vista. Gates' visit to The Daily Show could be a particularly interesting one; John Hodgman, a regular contributor on the show, plays a "PC" on the Apple commercials that poke fun at Windows-platform computers. The Daily Show, while taped earlier in the evening, airs at 11 p.m. EST, which is an hour before Vista's official midnight launch.
