Don't you love it when people say they hate talking about something and then they go ahead and do it regardless? Yes -- this is one of those cases, with that "something" being patents relating to iOS devices. In some cases patents work for Apple, and in some cases they work against Apple. (See my column on patent trolls, or read about Apple caving to Nokia and agreeing to pay a large lump sum for past sales of iOS devices and a license going forward for the sale of new ones.) Why I hate talking about patent issues is that they very rarely directly affect the end users. Does anyone who purchased an iOS device really care about the Nokia/Apple agreement? No. Going forward, it will not restrict any end users from being able to purchase an iOS device or change their pricing. Apple is not likely going to raise the price of the iPad from US$499 to $504.63 to cover additional license fees. Patent Hysteria Another story making its way around the tech circuit concerns Apple's application for a patent that would allow it to turn off the camera in your iOS device under particular circumstances. The patent is for technology that would transmit an IR signal to your phone and prevent the camera from working. This tech would presumably be designed for use at venues such as movie theaters or concert halls. This story has gotten legs and has crossed from the tech circuit over to the political circuit. Some are afraid that governments could abuse this technology. I even received an email from SaveTheInternet.com railing against Apple and Steve Jobs for "creating" this technology. I am usually in full support of SaveTheInternet.com, but this time not so much. The patent application it's complaining about was submitted back in December of 2009. Apple does not wait for patents to be issued to make tech available -- in many cases, it will apply for a patent after the tech or product is already in the marketplace. After all, if a technology is really worth using, Apple wants to get it out as fast as possible and does not want to wait for the USPTO to finish up its end of things. This is something that is lost on all those rumor sites that run articles about an upcoming feature or technology that Apple will have in a future iOS device because Apple has just submitted or received a patent for said technology. Again, if that feature were really worth being in an iOS device, the vast majority of the time it would already be there. That seems to be the case with the "camera kill switch" patent application. The technology is not in iOS devices now and is likely just one of many patent applications a company like Apple will file just because it can -- not because it plans to use the technology. Having a strong patent portfolio is hugely important in the tech world, which is why Google is starting the bidding for all of Nortel's patents at US$900 million, and why the final price paid will likely be well over twice that. Just Business Another Apple patent that was just issued -- Patent 7,966,578 -- is also causing a lot of buzz in the tech world. Depending on whom you believe, Patent 7,966,578 could be the patent that will end all smartphone competition in the U.S. or just another overreaching patent that the USPTO will revoke in short order. As with most things, the truth is probably somewhere in between. Apple will likely use this patent to get license fees from other makers of smartphones -- but it is not likely to try and force every other touchscreen device out of the U.S. market. That would almost surely invite a ruling against the Apple patent. (Aside from violence, the U.S. government is usually against monopolies.) This latest patent covers touchscreen smartphones: the gestures you use to control the iOS device and how you manipulate content in frames. At best, this means Apple will get some revenue from its competition. (Hi Nokia, remember that settlement you just won? Yeah, so does Apple.) This patent is an example of a technology that was already in place for many months before the patent application was submitted in December of 2007 -- about 11 months after the iPhone was announced and six months after it was available for purchase. The reason I don't like to talk about patents on my podcast is that patents generally fall into one of two categories. First are those covering what has already been done (e.g., the touchscreen patent). Second are those covering what theoretically could be done -- but has not been done, and likely never will be done. Which is why I don't generally cover patents. Either you are already using the tech or you will never see the tech, and the results of any fights about patents between the OEMs rarely, if ever, trickle down to the end user. That's something to think about the next time you get an email or read an article that says the sky is falling due to a patent application or award. Rob Walch is host of the Today in iOS podcast.

Silly view X9 Posted 2011-06-24 Before LED displays came to the iMac, a patent foretold of that. Before there was a camera on an iPhone, a patent foretold of that. Before there was an iPhone there were dozens of patents in 2006 foretelling of such. And an iCloud patent came out 3 weeks prior to it being official. This is why your story is so silly. Next. Apple's patent covering infrared technology for iOS cameras is legitimate. How left wing groups put a mythical spin on this is what's wrong here, not the patent application. It's about encoded data that is used for very specific applications. Third party's including the police don't have access to Apple's coding. Apple and a specific vendor (a museum, some top concerts, or art galleries) have to work together for this to work. It has nothing to with anything ...

It would compromise the delivery of critical health information. It would impair the operations of providers of needed services. People would not be able to order goods online. The damage to the global economy would be incalculable. Many people would not be able to communicate with loved ones and friends. It would make working from home impossible. Loss of entertainment options could threaten mental health.
