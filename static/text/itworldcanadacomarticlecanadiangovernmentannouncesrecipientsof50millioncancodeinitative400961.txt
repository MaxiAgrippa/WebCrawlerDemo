Navdeep Bains, Minister of Innovation, Sciences and Economic Development, listed the recipients of the CanCode initiative – a $50 million program that will give teachers and students, from kindergarten to Grade 12 the opportunity to learn digital skills such as coding – during a press conference at Microsoft’s office in Mississauga. Students receiving the training will range from kindergarten to Grade 12. Actua, the Boys and Girls Clubs of Canada, MediaSmarts and Brilliant Labs are just some of the funding recipients. “Technology is disrupting all facets of our lives. Digital literacy is new and necessary and an essential skill for the middle class jobs of today and tomorrow,” said Bains, adding it’s important that women and Indigenous Canadians learn how to code and develop digital skills.
