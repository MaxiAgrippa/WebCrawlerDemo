Netflix took home 24 Oscar nominations, mostly for movies like Marriage Story, The Two Popes, and The Irishman. Martin Scorsese’s three-and-a-half-hour epic received some of the Oscars’ most prestigious awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, and two Best Supporting Actor nominations for Al Pacino and Joe Pesci. (Robert De Niro did not receive a nomination.) Marriage Story, Noah Baumbach’s heartbreaking film about divorce, also earned six nominations in top categories, among others. Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson received Best Acting nominations, while director and writer Noah Baumbach got nods for Best Screenplay and Best Picture. Two Popes also earned a couple of nominations, with Jonathan Pryce picking up the nom for Best Actor. The stage is set for Netflix to redeem itself after the recent Golden Globe Awards. Netflix earned a total of 34 nominations, 16 of which were in the film category. Laura Dern won an award for Best Supporting Actress for her work in Marriage Story, but everyone else went home empty-handed. Since the Oscars are voted on by members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, there’s a better chance that Netflix could win big. The Oscars aren’t just celebrating Netflix, though. Joker, Little Women, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, and Jojo Rabbit all earned multiple nominations across a series of award categories, including acting, sound, editing, costume, writing, and directing spots. Joker earned 11 nominations, becoming the most nominated movie this year, with Little Women and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood earning six and nine, respectively. Jojo Rabbit, Taika Waititi’s film about a young boy in the Hitler Youth who tries to navigate World War II, earned six award nominations. Parasite also earned two top nominations, one for Best International Feature Film, as many predicted, and one for Best Picture, which many people hoped would happen. There were a few outliers, too. Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker earned a couple of nominations in the sound and editing category. Avengers: Endgame and The Lion King also earned nominations for visual effects. Kathy Bates earned a Best Supporting Actress nomination for her work in Clint Eastwood’s Richard Jewell. On the snub front, The Farewell was totally shut out, as was Uncut Gems. Greta Gerwig didn’t earn a nomination for directing for her work on Little Women, and Disney’s Frozen II did not earn a Best Animated Picture nomination. Still, for the most part, this year’s Oscar nominations went as predictably as expected. The full list is below.
