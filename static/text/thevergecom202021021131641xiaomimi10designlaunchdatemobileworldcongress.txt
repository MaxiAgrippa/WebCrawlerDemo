The company announced the Chinese launch on the Chinese social network Weibo and the global launch on Twitter. The two models, which will reportedly be named the Mi 10 and Mi 10 Pro, look to have four back cameras and, as is increasingly common, the curved screen has a hole-punch cutout for the selfie camera.

An apparent Chinese certification for the Mi 10 Pro suggests it will support 66-watt fast charging, which would just beat out the Oppo Reno Ace’s 65W charging speed. As other companies bail on their MWC plans out of coronavirus concerns, Xiaomi today reiterated that it will attend the conference.
