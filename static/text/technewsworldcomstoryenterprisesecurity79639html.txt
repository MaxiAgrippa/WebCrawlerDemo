Mello Jr. Dec 16, 2013 9:59 AM PT Can the ROI of PIM be measured by more than just revenue? Absolutely. Hear experts from Forrester Research and Zurn Industries explain how the value of PIM goes beyond operational efficiencies and share why product content is critical for delivering a great customer experience. Watch the webinar. Smartphones hacked to run unauthorized programs or unlock features are being targeted by hackers and can pose a threat to enterprise networks, warned Marble Security. Modifying a smartphone to enable unauthorized behavior -- called "rooting" in the Android world and "jailbreaking" in the iOS realm -- makes the mobile vulnerable to infected jammer software, the firm said. After jailbreaking or rooting a phone, a user may not be able to use it at work because networks often contain security tools that reject modified phones. To skirt those security measures, a user will install jammer software to hide the fact that a phone is modified. "A significant percentage of jailbroken and rooted phones have these jammers," Marble Chairman and CTO Dave Jevans told TechNewsWorld. "We're starting to see them included in rooting and jailbreaking kits," he added. Evolving Threat With organizations increasingly allowing employees to use their own devices to perform corporate chores, jammers can pose a serious threat to an enterprise. Experience shows us that even just one compromised device eventually can lead to a massive breach, Jevans said. While jammers aren't a new phenomenon, their use is evolving. "What we're seeing is more of them and they're getting more sophisticated," Jevans observed. "They're actually directly attacking MDM and other systems." MDM, or Mobile Device Management systems, have been installed by many organizations with BYOD -- Bring Your Own Device -- programs. Those programs can detect jailbroken or rooted devices and prevent them from coming onto the network. That protection often can be defeated by a jammer, thus allowing jailbroken or rooted devices full connectivity privileges to a network. Free Apps Have Security Costs Because free applications for Android smartphones are so popular, developers often resort to building their programs around SDK frameworks provided by advertisers to generate revenues from an app. Many of these SDKs have been rapped for collecting more information from a user's phone than necessary to accomplish their goals. That's not the only downside to those SDKs. They also can expose a smartphone to man-in-the-middle attacks. An SDK installed with an application "calls home," looks for a new version of the SDK, and then downloads it to a phone. It does that to keep the SDK up to date. "That's where the security issue comes in," Bogdan Botezatu, a senior e-threat analyst with Bitdefender, told TechNewsWorld. "It's being done over HTTP without encryption." "Anyone listening to that communication can intercept the request to the home server and send malicious information to the phone," Botezatu said. Making matters worse, no verification of information is done at the phone's end of things. "It just takes whatever's delivered to it from the Internet," Botezatu added. Phishing Paradigm Change Phishing ain't what it used to be. That's the verdict handed down last week by Websense in a special report on phishing. "Long gone are the days when users are faced almost exclusively with banking phishing," Websense Senior Research Manager Carl Leonard told TechNewsWorld. "Phishing has become more targeted," he added. In the past, phishers were content with the low success rates they achieved from massive mailings. "Now they can get higher rates of return through spear phishing," Leonard noted. "They can get high rates of return because the content they send to their targets is very tailored and appealing to them." The Websense report also identified the five most common subject lines found in phishing emails. They include an invitation to connect on LinkedIn, a mail delivery failed message, a "dear bank customer" letter, an "important communication!" message and a "return to sender" notification.
