Nicole Lee, @nicole 03.03.20 Comments 286 Shares Share Tweet Share Sponsored Links picture alliance via Getty Images Google has cancelled I/O, its annual developer conference, citing coronavirus concerns. The tech giant has sent out an email to all attendees informing them of the decision. I/O 2020 was set to be held from May 12th to the 14th at the Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View, California. According to the email, all guests will receive a refund by March 13th, and will be automatically granted an option to purchase a I/O 2021 ticket. "Due to concerns around the coronavirus (COVID-19), and in accordance with health guidance from the CDC, WHO, and other health authorities, we have decided to cancel the physical Google I/O event at Shoreline Amphitheatre," the email states. "Over the coming weeks, we will explore other ways to evolve Google I/O to best connect with and continue to build our developer community. We'll continue to update the Google I/O website." A #GoogleIO update. Due to concerns around the coronavirus (COVID-19), we've decided to cancel this year's physical event at Shoreline Amphitheatre. It's sad that we won't be able to gather as a developer community but your health and safety is our priority.
