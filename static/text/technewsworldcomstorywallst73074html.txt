Print Email By Katherine Noyes • LinuxInsider • ECT News Network Aug 15, 2011 5:00 AM PT 2020 online shopping habits and retailer strategies For the fourth year in a row, Episerver has surveyed over 4,000 global online shoppers to learn about their ecommerce expectations and habits. Download Reimagining Commerce now to get an exclusive look at successful retail strategies in 2020. Now that Microsoft wants to be Linux's new best friend, there's bound to be no end of sweet nothings and touching gestures emanating out of Redmond. After all, we're pals now, right? Lo and behold! For all you skeptics who doubted the software behemoth's amorous words, consider a few phrasing changes it recently made in its last two annual financial filings. 'So Much for All Those Predictions' Whereas said documents used to include Linux as a primary threat to Windows -- alongside Apple and Google -- Redmond's documents now reportedly don't mention any competitive threat from desktop Linux at all, according to a recent article on Business Insider, which cites a tweet by Directions on Microsoft's Wes Miller. Rather, the documents list only Apple and Google as Windows' primary threats on the desktop. Of course, embedded Linux is still acknowledged as a problem in that arena -- not to mention servers, of course -- but author Matt Rosoff (formerly with Directions on Microsoft as well, it most certainly should be noted) comes to a very happy conclusion anyway: "So much for all those predictions that Linux would kill Windows," he writes. Awww, isn't that nice? We really *are* friends now! 'MS Is Very Afraid of Linux' Then again, maybe not. "The actions 'speak' louder than the words," wrote SAL-e in the comments on Business Insider. "Microsoft is acting like patent troll and filing law-suits left and right," SAL-e explained. "MS is very afraid of Linux, especially in the mobile arena." Similar sentiments could be heard down at the blogosphere's Broken Windows Lounge. "They only downgraded Linux as a threat on the desktop, so the underhanded FUD and legal attacks are likely to continue," consultant and Slashdot blogger Gerhard Mack told Linux Girl. 'The Reality Distortion Field' Indeed, "the last time I looked, the threats Google represents to both Microsoft and Apple all carried 'Powered by Linux' stickers," noted Barbara Hudson, a blogger on Slashdot who goes by "Tom" on the site. "Those tablets and smartphones and web-based apps and ChromeOS laptops with their Google DNA and Linux underpinnings are all direct threats to the Windows OS, so I wouldn't say this is a downgrading of Linux, but an acceptance that Google is going to be the primary way that most people will adopt Linux without realizing it," Hudson explained. "Of course, it would take a Microsoftie to tweet that this means 'Linux isn't a threat to the Windows desktop any longer,' she added, quoting Miller's words. "This proves two things: Apple and Steve Jobs don't have a monopoly on the Reality Distortion Field, and Twitter -- with its 140-character limit -- is never going to be the source of any serious analysis." 'Threat Level Is Red' Linux is "not an operating system but a component of many operating systems, all of which are taking a slice of M$'s pie: GNU/Linux, Android/Linux, Meego and WebOS," agreed blogger Robert Pogson. "Whereas M$ used to have weak competition from GNU/Linux and MacOS, they are now surrounded and holed at the water-line." Microsoft is "still dishonest," Pogson added. "A 'PC' is a personal computer and not necessarily one with M$'s OS. There is not much indication that demand for PCs will reduce, but PCs running M$'s OS certainly are being replaced with more functional units at lower prices. "M$, after decades, is now having to compete on price/performance," he concluded. Bottom line? "Threat level is Red," Pogson added. 'The Year the Desktop All But Goes Away' Hyperlogos blogger Martin Espinoza took a similar view. "It looks like there won't be any year of the Linux desktop, mostly because it's going to be the year the desktop all but goes away," Espinoza told Linux Girl. "Pundits have long predicted the virtual disappearance of the computer as we know it, and the broad acceptance of powerful smartphones seems to be putting the truth to that once seemingly ridiculous proclamation," he added. 'Filled to the Brim with Zealots' Slashdot blogger and Windows fan hairyfeet saw it differently. In fact, Linux really isn't a threat to Microsoft, hairyfeet told Linux Girl. "For little shops like mine it would be really nice if it was, but it really isn't," hairyfeet said. Linux also hasn't improved in the past two years, he added: "Drivers are just as buggy, upgrades still kill hardware, waaaay too many things are tied to what kernel version you have, and the whole thing is filled to the brim with zealots that act like you kicked a puppy if you dare to point out what is wrong. "It has been 20 years since Linus released the Linux kernel, and it still hasn't gotten above the margin of error," he concluded. "Why? Simple -- Linux is BY geeks and FOR geeks, and not a single one with any power will listen to the users." 'Linux Will Continue to Make Inroads' Chris Travers, a Slashdot blogger who works on the LedgerSMB project, wasn't convinced that Microsoft's changed wording had much significance. "It does represent a developing understanding that Windows is deeply entrenched in some markets and Linux as a general operating system is not really able to unseat it at the present moment," Travers said. "I think that Linux will continue to make inroads into these areas slowly, however." In the long run, though, the real threats to Microsoft and Windows may have nothing to do with operating systems, Hudson suggested. 'The Tech Elephant Graveyard' "It's become an ingrained truth that Microsoft cannot take the initiative; its actions are knee-jerk responses to products and services from Apple and Google," she explained. "Nobody believes that Microsoft is capable of planning and executing anything really new and innovative, or even buying successful technology and integrating it," Hudson added. "Rather, it is the tech Elephant Graveyard, the place where other companies (Danger, Nokia, etc.) go to die. "Of course, a more up-front appraisal would have listed Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer as the biggest threat to Microsoft," she added. "But that's a whole other story."

Are you sure there is that big of a diffrence? M$ is worried about *nix, As well as google, and even Apple. Take the Android, it has done to Linux what Apple did to Unix, put a new face on it and make it so simple any maroon could use it. If linux gets its GPL settled then Google wont make as much money off of it.Why? Because then it wont have to be open, they can close it off and people wont even know its there, just like Apple. M$ is worried because of Novels Mono, and Java's JavaFX, That basicly makes silverlight, WPF, and .NET worthless. Honestly, Linux is much stronger backend and Windows is a better frontend. But Google has opened doors, as well as Sony, because now Android powered by Linux is becoming a powerhouse, giving a simple frontend ui that you dont need much smarts in order ... Read More Reply Always the shill Runaway1956 Posted 2011-08-15 Hairyfeet always cast Microsoft in the best light, and Linux in the worst. How would you define such a position? Face it - Microsoft is the biggest threat to computing, while Linux IS computing! Reply Oh Please! hairyfeet Posted 2011-08-16 Can you slurp the koolaid a little harder? Just like a Linux zealot, fighting the last battle while a big old train called Google is bearing right down on you! Notice that Google REFUSES to allow ANY GPL V3? Why do you think that is? It is because as one of the developers said "Android is free FOR OEMS" and the rest of that sentence unspoken is "And NOT for you silly user!" And you want to hear what I think is wrong with MSFT? Okay here goes: The mobile strategy is flinging poo at a wall and hoping something sticks, Ballmer has ZERO direction as a CEO, instead of heavily promoting Windows 7 he appears to be cooking up an Apple ripoff for Win 8 that will go down in flames (but at least we get 8 YEARS of support for Win 7, something Linux doesn't come close on), he got rid of ...

We can be like they are - don't fear the Google!" Yeah - it's cheaper to use Windows, today. That being the result of a decade and more of "exclusivity" agreements between Microsoft and vendors. Come on - we KNOW where MS is, and how they got there. It's an old refrain - "If Linux were any good, hardware manufacturers would be making drivers for Linux" blah blah blah. Fortunately for Microsoft, and unfortunately for the world, George Bush's administration halted the monopoly proceedings against Microsoft. The landscape would be drastically different today, had those proceedings proceeded. But, whatever - I just get tired ... Read More Reply Are you REALLY this clueless? hairyfeet Posted 2011-08-16 Or maybe YOU are a shill for Red Hat? Because if you think ANY HOME USERS are gonna play your little CLI games? Well I have a nice bridge you might be interested in. PROTIP: Home users will NEVER EVER in a million years touch your CLI garbage because they see it for what it is, which is a 1970s throwback that belongs in the garbage dump of history! You know why Linux has a term, so prominent that in a good 80%+ of distros they even have a link to the term on the desktop? it is because you HAVE NO CHOICE. You really really don't. Anything goes wrong with an update? "Open up bash and type" Problem with the network? "Open up bash and type". Driver problem, app problem, dependency problem? "Open up bash and type". But I hate to break the news to ya sparky, ... Read More Reply LCD Runaway1956 Posted 2011-08-16 Television was once touted as a great educational tool, in addition to a communications tool. It had such a bright future. Alas - today, it's nothing more than the Lowest Common Denominator. It appeals to the mindless, the stupid, the braindead - and the more intelligent people are kind of stuck with it. And, that's what Windows is. Windows is the moronic sitcom, the thriller, the action movie, of the computing world. And, here you are reveling in the fact that a moron doesn't even have to know how to spell "computer" in order to download his p0rn, and any other of the entertainment of that infamous LCD. Can't stand that CLI? Why? Is it really that hard to deal with? Really? You're smart enough to fix and to sell computers to any of the LCD's that walk in off ... Read More Reply Save us the hacker BS, kay? hairyfeet Posted 2011-08-16 right nobody loves me cause I'm so hip and leet, is that REALLY what you are saying? Are you HONESTLY trying to say that CLI gives you magical gonad powers? because I find that pretty darn funny. Sure making things harder just makes a man out of you skippy, now push this rock up this hill! What a vehicle? Modern technology? Piffle that ain't the manly way to do things, you need to do things like when the PDP11 was king boy! Yeah enjoy your total delusional BS, the rest of the world? Will keep ignoring your worthless badly designed crapola. hey why don't you throw away those CDs and go back to punch cards while you are at it? Real men carry their data on cardboard! Jeez what a bunch of total stupidity. yeah making things easy for users? Why that's just dumbing down daddy o, you need ... Read More Reply The time for desktop Linux may indeed be short RobertoLim Posted 2011-08-15 I think to understand Microsoft's downgrading of the Linux threat level, you have to look at the Microsoft mindset. For more than a decade they have followed the strategy of instilling Microsoft dependency. MS has always lobbied hard with OEM's to make sure Windows was pre-installed. MS has also given away free licenses to educational institutions, sold cheap license in developing countries and basically done everything it can to make sure that when you saw your first computer, well it had Windows on it. When Linux looked like it might have room in the netbook market, MS extended the life and lowered the price of its Windows XP licenses to make sure Linux would not get a foothold in the netbook market. To someone who equate a computer with Windows, well that person won't even try ... Read More Reply Be relentless; ... kibert Posted 2011-08-15 ...keep up the puppy-kicking. Next time, go for a field goal. Reply I do my best hairyfeet Posted 2011-08-19 I take VERY seriously my position as "the voice of the common man" which I deal with 6 days a week and which apparently most of the community has never even met! They think being forced to use a term because their OS simply can't function without it gives them magical gonad powers? it makes them a bad joke! Its 2011 and everyone else abandoned terminals a LONG time ago! You think they would get hit with the clue bat when the ONLY thing that has even the teeniest tiniest bit of Linux making ANY headway with consumers is Android which....surprise surprise....is all GUI and NO TERMINAL! What? gasp? Linux without a terminal? why Linux without a terminal makes RMS cry! That is why I see the future as Google simply taking the toys away from them. if Google forks ... Read More Reply Too True! CityDog Posted 2011-08-20 Hairyfeet, that's the best analysis I've read in a long while. As a "common man" -- but one who is nonetheless technically inclined -- I've played around with Linux for years. I can use Linux as my primary desktop, if I want ... but why would I want to? It's not that all Linux distros are terrible, but they are a bit of a mess. Importantly, there's no critical mass building, for all the reasons hairyfeet has outlined. Which means that essential software and drivers will not be ported. Basic things like hooking up to a wireless printer, or getting your camera recognized -- the stuff that has to "just work" if us "common men" (and women) are going to embrace a platform -- are ridiculously complicated. Yes, your grandmother can use Linux, but only if her ... Read More Reply I just don't get it hairyfeet Posted 2011-08-20 It is like reality and the Linux community are these two complete opposites that like matter and antimatter can't get together without an explosion! I mean do you see ANY consumer device that pushes a terminal BESIDES Linux? Of course not, that junk died out in 1994, yet what does the community do? "Terms are leet! they make you have gonad powerz! Put it on the desktop!" There is NO vision, NO common sense, not even the slightest thought for the common man/woman and what they might want/need, none at all. The entire planet is supposed to throw away nearly 2 decades of GUIs to embrace...terminals? Bash? Recompiling? Do they get a free neckbeard with purchase as well? The sad part is there are plenty of guys like me that have been holding up flaming signs for ...
