Hear Amanda LeClair from Forrester Research and Elizabeth Haubenreiser from Zurn Industries discuss the value of PIM and how it impacts the entire customer journey. Watch the on-demand webinar and discover what PIM can do for your business. Avaya has introduced Intelligence Presence, a new software application that gives users -- both in corporate environments and call centers -- the ability to view so-called presence information across multiple sources. For example, it would allow a contact center rep engaged with a caller to see if a partner company had a rep available to provide answers about shipping schedules or rates. This application addresses a problem that has been fundamental to the quality of customer care that many callers receive -- or don't -- from contact center representatives, according to Ken Landoline, a Yankee Group analyst. Achieving Full Potential "My main concern for contact centers reaching their full fruition of capabilities," Landoline told CRM Buyer, "is that somebody has had to tackle the issue of supplying federated managed presence throughout the enterprise." Federated managed presence refers to the ability to manage applications across multiple channels to see where data resides and, in the case of a contact center operation, who is available to speak. Avaya has stepped up to address the issue, he said. "I thought it could have been done by Microsoft or IBM, since they are active with instant messaging applications," Landoline continued. "It is to Avaya's credit that it is taking that step." Multiple Challenges Avaya Intelligent Presence is based on a multi-vendor, multi-protocol approach. It collects and then displays presence information on the desktop, in a telephony system or a software application. It is able to integrate these diverse sources from different vendor platforms through the use of multiple protocols. The server is based on the Jabber Extensible Communications Platform. Jabber's contribution to Avaya's already established presence platform, which is based on XMPP (extensible messaging and presence protocol), is the introduction of SIP/SIMPLE support. Ready for the Enterprise Though federated presence may one day rule the contact center, as Landoline envisions, the immediate use of Avaya's latest addition to its product line is likely to be corporate. For example, a company with many reps on the road would know how to best to reach each of its staff members at any particular moment -- by cell, instant message or e-mail. When embedded into business applications and processes, the application automatically connects the person designated to act on a certain issue through the communications channel available at that moment. The server also allows employees to selectively segment who can reach them and by what means.

It would compromise the delivery of critical health information. It would impair the operations of providers of needed services. People would not be able to order goods online. The damage to the global economy would be incalculable. Many people would not be able to communicate with loved ones and friends. It would make working from home impossible.
