Here's how to add your Starbucks card to Passbook. Jason Cipriani October 4, 2012 11:57 AM PDT Jason Cipriani/CNET Yesterday, Starbucks updated its iPhone app with iOS 6 compatibility, including the much anticipated Passbook integration. Adding your card to Passbook is easy, and takes just a few minutes. You're now just a few short steps away from adding a Starbucks card to your Passbook. Assuming you already have the Starbucks app installed on your iPhone, make sure you've downloaded the update from the App Store. Screenshot by Jason Cipriani/CNET The first time you launch the updated app on your iOS 6 device, you'll immediately be asked if you want to add your card to Passbook. Tap on OK. If you're not prompted, for whatever reason, you can tap on the Manage button located beneath the card and select Add to Passbook.

Doing so will allow for your Starbucks pass to show up on your lock screen when you walk into your favorite location. This is intended to keep your pass at your fingertips. If you'd rather not set your favorite locations, you can always come back into the Starbucks app and add them under the Stores tab. They will automatically sync to your pass once you do. Screenshot by Jason Cipriani/CNET After you have added your favorite locations, or skipped adding them, the app will take a few seconds to create your pass. Once you're presented with your pass, tap on Add to save it to your Passbook. Screenshot by Jason Cipriani/CNET If you added a favorite location, you'll see an alert on your lock screen when you're close enough to it. Swiping the icon over, as you would with any alert on iOS, will reveal your Starbucks pass, while leaving your iPhone locked. Show your pass to the barista when you order, as you normally would using the Starbucks app, to make a payment. You'll receive an alert through Passbook when your balance updates, and any changes you make to locations or card information is synced automatically to Passbook. There's a right way to integrate an app or service with Passbook and it's clear Starbucks is doing it the right way.
