The overall theme was concepts, our staff determined when deliberating the annual Verge Awards at CES 2020, which meant a lot of show without a lot of substance: This year, the things that stole attention at the show were not early looks at products that you and I will be able to actually use and buy over the next 12 months. Sure, there’s the occasional laptop and meat substitute that will be available for purchase in 2020. But for every one of those, there’s a rolling ball robot, virtual personal attendant, or entire vehicle that is never likely to ship. Our Best in Show award went to Lenovo’s Thinkpad X1 Fold, which — even though it’s on the expensive side and left us with a few questions — was the only foldable laptop with a confirmed shipping window and price tag. Most of the other laptops at this year’s CES were pretty boring, however, with little more than incremental updates on display. But there may be hope for the future with 5G modems and new screen technologies on the horizon. We doled out awards for the most triumphant CES comeback (Lora DiCarlo), the most overhyped thing at this year’s show (Samsung’s Neon digital avatars), and the most concept (Sony’s Vision-S) as well. Of course, the best non-CES news that everyone at the show was talking about was Sonos’ lawsuit against Google, in which, it accuses the tech giant of patent infringement. You can find the full list of the best of CES 2020 here. 176 Total Updates Since Dec 19, 2019, 2:56am EST Follow this stream January 6 Wemo’s new WiFi Smart Plug gets an even tinier redesign By Chaim Gartenberg@cgartenberg Along with the Wemo Stage, a HomeKit-compatible scene remote 8 comments / new January 6 Belkin partners with Devialet for a Google Assistant smart speaker that’s also a wireless charger By Chaim Gartenberg@cgartenberg Jack of all trades 5 comments / new January 6 Linksys combines 5G and fast Wi-Fi 6 networking in new gear By Thomas Ricker@Trixxy Four new products coming this year 2 comments / new January 6 MSI’s new gaming laptops have speedy 300Hz displays and massive 99.9Wh batteries By Jay Peters@jaypeters But they could be expensive 7 comments / new January 6 Watch Sony unveil its Vision-S concept car and reveal the new PS5 logo By Nick Statt@nickstatt A PS5 logo reveal and a Sony concept car 1 comment / new January 6 Roland’s new hardware is a ‘plug and play’ mini studio for smartphone vloggers By Dani Deahl@danideahl Catering to online content creators January 6 SanDisk’s prototype 8TB external SSD is the biggest ever made By Chaim Gartenberg@cgartenberg Plus a 1TB flash drive you can actually buy January 6 Moshi’s chargers, cables, and batteries now come with a 10-year warranty By Jon Porter@JonPorty Register your product for the warranty to take effect 4 comments / new January 6 Netgear’s new Nighthawk Mesh offers Wi-Fi 6 for less By Dan Seifert@dcseifert A two-node Wi-Fi 6 system for under $250 3 comments / new January 6 Bluetooth will support hearing aids, sharing, and a better audio codec By Dieter Bohn@backlon Bluetooth may really get better next year 6 comments / new January 6 Netgear’s Nighthawk M5 mobile hot spot combines 5G with Wi-Fi 6 By Dan Seifert@dcseifert 4 Gbps connections on the go 2 comments / new January 6 Canon announces the EOS-1D X Mark III because the DSLR still isn’t dead By Dan Seifert@dcseifert Canon’s top-of-the-line pro sports camera gets a refresh 11 comments / new January 6 Sony surprises with an electric concept car called the Vision-S By Sean O'Kane@sokane1 Wait, what? 150 comments / new January 6 Sony reveals PlayStation 5 logo and shares PSVR sales milestone By Nick Statt@nickstatt Five million virtual reality headsets sold 10 comments / new January 6 Intel announces its first discrete DG1 GPU By Chaim Gartenberg@cgartenberg Intel is getting in the graphics game 15 comments / new January 6 Impossible Foods is launching plant-based pork and sausage this year By Jay Peters@jaypeters You can try Impossible Sausage at select Burger King restaurants soon 72 comments / new January 6 AMD just admitted it showed us a fake Xbox Series X render By Tom Warren@tomwarren A major oops 50 comments / new January 6 Intel’s Horseshoe Bend concept is a look at the future of foldable PCs By Sam Byford@345triangle A sleek 17-inch OLED monster 15 comments / new January 6 AMD’s 64-core Threadripper CPU will cost nearly $4,000 for its high-end performance By Tom Warren@tomwarren These new high-end chips will arrive in February 6 comments / new January 6 LG’s roll-up TV is shipping this year and could cost $60,000 By Adi Robertson@thedextriarchy It’s been tested for 50,000 rolls 5 comments / new January 6 AMD’s 7nm Ryzen 4000 CPUs are here to take on Intel’s 10nm Ice Lake laptop chips By Chaim Gartenberg@cgartenberg Bringing the Zen 2 architecture to laptops 5 comments / new January 6 TCL will enable variable refresh rates for some TVs later this year By Jay Peters@jaypeters It’s also partnered with THX on a new game mode 2 comments / new January 6 Comcast now has a Wi-Fi 6 router for its high-speed customers By Jay Peters@jaypeters The company is also making its security service free if you lease an xFi router 6 comments / new January 6 Dell’s Concept Ori and Concept Duet laptops imagine a foldable and dual-screen future By Chaim Gartenberg@cgartenberg Photography by Becca Farsace Dell thinks the future has a lot more screen space 2 comments / new January 6 Sony’s first TVs of 2020 include its smallest 4K OLED ever By Jon Porter@JonPorty Alongside another 8K monster 11 comments / new Pagination Prev 176 results : Page 4 of 8 Next Chorus Terms of Use Privacy Notice Cookie Policy Do not sell my info Communications Preferences Licensing FAQ Accessibility Platform Status Contact Tip Us Community Guidelines About Ethics Statement Vox Media Vox Media Vox Media logo.
