Watch the webinar. Apple investors were socked with a tricky one-two combo punch this week as they learned worrying news about the company's CEO as well as some encouraging information about its 2010 holiday-season performance. Apple on Tuesday announced it hit all-time highs for revenues and profits in the first quarter of its fiscal year 2011. It posted revenues of US$26.74 billion and had a net quarterly profit of $6 billion, which works out to $6.43 per diluted share. The announcement came after the U.S. markets closed, so its effects on Apple's share prices can't really be gauged until Wednesday. However, the market was jittery all day Tuesday following news that Apple CEO Steve Jobs had taken his second medical leave of absence within two years. Apple share prices kept sliding in very volatile trading Tuesday, falling to $340.65 at closing, down $7.83. Perhaps the market was concerned about the wording of Job's announcement -- he had said he "hoped" to return, which raised doubt regarding his ability to return to his office. Despite this, analysts expressed confidence in Apple's future. Apple's Earnings Apple's revenues of nearly $27 billion were 70 percent higher than the $15.7 billion it chalked up in the first quarter FY 2010, while its net quarterly profit of $6 billion was almost 78 percent higher than the $3.38 billion quarterly profit figure it chalked up in the year-ago period. International sales accounted for 62 percent of this quarter's revenue compared to 58 percent a year ago. Gross margin was down, from 40.9 percent the previous quarter to 38.5 percent. Apple sold 4.13 million Macs during the quarter. This was a 23 percent unit increase over the year-ago figure of 3.36 million. It saw iPhone sales grow 86 percent year over year to 16.24 million units in the December quarter. However, iPod sales declined 7 percent year over year, from 21 million units to 19.45 million. Apple sold 7.33 million iPads during the December quarter. Apple had a "phenomenal holiday quarter with record Mac, iPhone and iPad sales," CEO Steve Jobs said. He said the company has "some exciting things" in the pipeline this year. The Steve Jobs Effect Although it was widely expected that Apple would have a stellar quarter, the company's stock prices kept sliding Tuesday, largely due to fears about Jobs' health. Jobs emailed Apple employees Monday to tell them he's taking a medical leave of absence and hopes to be back as soon as possible. He will continue functioning as CEO, however, and will be involved in major strategic decisions. The ambiguity around the possibility of his return may have sparked concern among investors. Apple prices fell 7 percent on the European markets after the announcement and continued their slide on Wall Street. However, analysts and observers maintained their confidence in Apple. Apple Chief Operating Officer Tim Cook, who'll run day-to-day operations at the company as he did when Jobs went on medical leave previously, is a proven executive who knows what he's doing, Barclays Capital said in a note to investors Tuesday. Barclays said it knows Apple's succession plan and believes the company's in capable hands. Apple's fundamentals remain very strong, Barclays said, setting a price target for the company's stocks at $420. No CEO Is an Island Jobs has achieved rock star status among corporate leaders, but Apple's success doesn't depend on him alone, and he's built up a solid management team over the years, a process that was probably enhanced by his having fallen ill previously, Laura DiDio, principal at ITIC, told MacNewsWorld. There are fears that COO Tim Cook is more an operations man than a visionary, but that shouldn't matter, DiDio suggested. "Sure, he's an operations guy," DiDio said. "So what? Tim's been very close to Jobs, he's sat on the right hand of the throne for several years. So people say he doesn't have Steve Jobs' vision. Who at Walt Disney had Walt's vision or business sense? Disney survived." Apple's leadership team -- consisting of Cook, CFO Peter Oppenheimer, design maven Jonathan Ive and marketing guru Phil Schiller -- has been working together for most of a decade, Carl Howe, director of anywhere consumer research at the Yankee Group, pointed out. "No one's going to replace Jobs, but there are a lot of people who can take a well-oiled machine to the next level," Howe remarked. Can Apple Soldier On? Jobs has left Apple fairly well set for now, DiDio said. "Tim Cook only has to execute on Jobs' vision from an operational standpoint for the next year or two," she stated. "You don't need a magic product every year." Further, Jobs has laid the groundwork well for Apple's continued drive into the enterprise market, DiDio stated. "One of the things Apple did last year that didn't get enough play was inking a deal for tech service and support in enterprises with Unisys," DiDio said. The agreement calls for Unisys to provide maintenance and other services for Apple devices to companies and government agencies. Unisys has had a long history of providing tech support to government agencies and large enterprises. However, Apple may not fare too well in the long run, warned Will Stofega, a program director at IDC. "Tim Cook has proven himself able to manage the day-to-day business in the short term, but he's an operations guy," Stofega remarked. "That's an important thing to have, but this company is looked upon as an image maker, and it needs a creative mind." Jobs has a "great creative team, but the creative direction comes from him," Stofega added. Other Apple Factors There's the usual mix of good news and bad news this week. Mac sales grew 17 percent year over year (YoY) in December, Barclays Capital said, citing data from NPD. However, that seems to be the tail end of a slide -- Mac sales grew 20 percent YoY in October and 19 percent YoY in November. New MacBook Air products and strong overseas sales gives Barclays Capital confidence Apple will continue to do well. Sales of iPads and iPods were also strong, Barclays Capital said. Meanwhile, Android tablets are challenging the iPad; there's the usual to-do about which mobile OS is doing better in the market, Android or iOS; Consumer Reports has warned users against getting the Verizon iPhone 4 because it's dated; and let's not forget the iTunes App Store, which is expected to see its 10 billionth download this month. Yes, that's billion with a "b." Where does all this leave investors? Buy Apple stocks if the prices fall to $300 again but, until then, don't worry, recommended Brian Marshall, an analyst at Gleacher. "When Apple stocks hit the $300 mark, the market will have factored in Steve Jobs' absence," Marshall explained. His price target for Apple stocks is $355.
