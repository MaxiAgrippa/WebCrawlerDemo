Social Sharing CBC News · Posted: Feb 08, 2010 3:39 PM ET | Last Updated: April 5, 2011 The space shuttle Endeavour is due to deliver a new facility that includes life-support systems, living quarters and an observation dome to the International Space Station on Wednesday. Dubbed Tranquility, or less poetically, Node 3, the new unit will house exercise machines and a toilet and will have an expansive window, referred to as the Cupola, attached to it. The European Space Agency funded the construction of the new module and dome. After Endeavour's 13-day mission, the space station will be 98 per cent complete. Here is a map of the ISS and some of its main facilities.
