After a series of leaked images from Instagram user amacro13 on Wednesday appeared to show off the Batmobile on the streets of Detroit, director Zack Snyder took to Twitter to post "a real picture" of the Batmobile in all its glory. The photo was taken by photographer Clay Enos, who also responded to the leaked images with a tweet that proclaimed: "iPhone photography is great but some things deserve more. #batmobile (Nikon D800 ISO 500 24mm f/11 1/25th sec)" Related Links 4D Batman roller coaster tosses you to Gotham and back Batman spotted ripping up roads on a reversed Bat-trike The new Batmobile looks like a cross between the Tumbler from the "Dark Knight" trilogy and the awesome-looking Batmobile from the upcoming Arkham Knight video game.
