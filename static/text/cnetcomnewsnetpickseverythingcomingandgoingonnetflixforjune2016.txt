Find out what else is streaming in June. Iyaz Akhtar May 23, 2016 9:23 AM PDT Leer en español Alex Vause was horrified by what those ducks were doing just off frame. Netflix June brings lots of big Netflix originals. The fourth season of "Orange is the New Black" arrives on June 17. Apparently, the show is going to become a bit darker. On the lighter side, Netflix will stream season one of "Voltron: Legendary Defender" starting on June 10. I was a huge Voltron fan when I was a kid, so I will definitely be checking it out. Bo Burnham has a new comedy special called "Bo Burnham: Make Happy" hitting Netflix on June 3. One of my guilty pleasure shows, "Breaking the Magician's Code: Magic's Biggest Secrets Finally Revealed" arrives on Netflix in June. The show featured a masked magician showing off tricks illusions while Mitch Pileggi narrates with terrible comedy.
