Amanda Kooser October 2, 2014 11:20 AM PDT This is as soft as the Batmobile gets. Hot Topic If you're planning to go in costume to the release of "Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice" in 2016, you might want to give some consideration to what to wear on your feet. I propose a pair of comfortable, yet appropriately themed slippers, such as these Batmobile slippers. More aggressive than pink-bunny slippers and less cuddly than tribble slippers, these Batmobile slippers are the preferred choice for moody superheroes with cold toes. They are described as having a "soft and cozy lining and grip soles." Just what you need after a long, hard day of fighting crime. The slippers are available through Hot Topic, a clothing chain that at least partially caters to a geek audience, for $19.50 (about £12, AU$22). Related stories Check out the new Batmobile for the Superman/Batman movie Tribble slippers are no trouble at all Ben Affleck's rugged new Batmobile revealed A closer examination of the plush foot accessories reveals an interesting design decision: the slippers are based on the Batmobile first introduced in the 1989 Tim Burton-directed "Batman" movie starring Michael Keaton. It has fins and a turbine jet engine on the back. Your feet fit into the vehicle's cockpit. Perhaps this design was chosen because it's more recognizable when translated into slippers than, say, the Tumbler look from Christian Bale's Batman movies. We can all be glad the slippers don't depict the Batmobile from the 1997 "Batman & Robin" movie featuring George Clooney. As much as I hope Ben Affleck is lounging around the "Batman v Superman" set sporting Batmobile slippers, it's probably not very likely -- especially since these are sold under the "girls" section at Hot Topic, rather than the guys. You never know, he might be able to squeeze into an XL. Next time I see a promo photo of Affleck in his Batsuit with his feet out of frame, I'll imagine he's wearing these in tribute to Keaton's time in black. Maybe it's time to bring Michael Keaton back as Batman.
