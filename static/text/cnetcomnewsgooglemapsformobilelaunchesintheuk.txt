Some of you may already have been using the American version, but this UK-specific, Java-based application includes Tube stations and local search. In order to use Google Maps on your mobile phone, it needs to supports Java applications, which most medium to high-end mobile phones sold in the last two years do. You can download the Google Map mobile application from google.co.uk/gmm. Once on your phone, the app lets you look up directions similar to the desktop version and also lets you see streets in satellite mode, which is great if you want to show off your new house. Local search lets you look up local businesses and find out information such as telephone numbers and post codes. You can even use it to find out what your GP's address is, or where the nearest pizza joint is. Similar to the desktop version, you can plan a route and see where you need to go, via a highlighted line that shows the way to your destination. The application is free to download and use, but you will incur data charges, so make sure to find out how much you pay for mobile data. If you're on a flat-rate data plan such as T-Mobile's Web'n'Walk or 3's X-Series then you needn't worry. -Andrew Lim Comments Phones Notification on Notification off Mobile Close Discuss: Google Maps for mobile launches in the UK Sign in to comment Be respectful, keep it civil and stay on topic.
