Tom Krazit March 13, 2008 9:15 PM PDT Apple has announced the dates for its annual Worldwide Developers Conference, once again scheduled for San Francisco in June. Apple developers will occupy the Moscone Center in downtown San Francisco from June 9 through the 13, according to Apple. No keynote plans have been announced as of Thursday, but usually a guy named Steve gets up onstage to talk about stuff. Three tracks are planned for this year's WWDC: Mac, IT, and iPhone, which will likely be the most closely watched technology at the conference. Apple has said it plans to release the formal versions of both the iPhone software development kit and the iPhone 2.0 software in June, and what better time than during a conference of developers? UPDATED 4:12pm - Well, that is, except for the fact that Apple said late June was the expected ship date for the new iPhone software, as one reader points out. Still, plenty of iPhone developers will have much to learn during their week in San Francisco about iPhone development, official SDK or not.
