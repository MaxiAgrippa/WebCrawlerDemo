Caroline McCarthy October 19, 2006 8:09 AM PDT Here in the States, LG's latest buzzworthy item is the Shine phone, but the Korean electronics company is making waves overseas with...designer fridges. Luxury-gadget blog Born Rich has alerted us to LG's "Art Cool" line. The latest addition to this swanky collection is , decorated with a floral design by Korean painter Seung-rim Ha and spiced up with embedded Swarovski crystals. Not exactly the sort of place where you'd stash your leftover take-out food and six-packs of Bud Light. The Art Cool fridge may never be sold stateside, but something tells me that Americans who would actually buy this probably have the means to hop a private jet to Seoul or Dubai and pick one out.
