Hear Amanda LeClair from Forrester Research and Elizabeth Haubenreiser from Zurn Industries discuss the value of PIM and how it impacts the entire customer journey. Watch the on-demand webinar and discover what PIM can do for your business. So, you have a product or two. You want to expand your reach. The global Internet sits at your fingertips. If you build it, will they come? Not necessarily. That is the big lesson of the bubble years -- and a quandary for small e-commerce companies at a time when venture capitalists are not feeling adventurous. How can small sites build a reputation, drive traffic and foster brand loyalty? This is not an easy task in tight economic times, but if a company is resourceful, several tactics can lead to e-commerce success. The Right Stuff The first principle of online selling, especially for small businesses that cannot afford to make many mistakes, is to sell the right items. Trying to sell the wrong product online is like failing to hitch the horse to the wagon -- you can do everything else right, and you still will not get anywhere. Not every product is appropriate for online sales, and those that are may already have reached saturation level in the e-commerce landscape. Yankee Group analyst Adi Kishore recommends evaluating a new e-commerce venture before launching it. "Take a long, hard look at your business model," Kishore told the E-Commerce Times. "Is anyone else doing it? Develop specialty products." Kishore noted that commodity products lend themselves to online transactions but are often overexposed by giant e-tailers. The trick is to advance a unique product niche within a commodity category. Targeted Efforts Advertising is another potential pitfall. Mass-market advertising is not only too expensive for most small e-commerce ventures, but it does not even work well for them. "With blanket advertising, you're wasting half your budget, and you don't know which half," IDC research manager Jonathan Gaw told the E-Commerce Times. Instead, companies should explore more finely targeted, and in some cases experimental, promotions. The good news for new and small companies is that they do not have to learn this lesson the hard way, as many e-commerce pioneers did. In finding targeted media in which to inject a message, the key is to think across channels. For example, just because a company is trying to transact business online does not mean it should ignore brick-and-mortar promotional opportunities. Even in the online space, it is not all about Web promotion -- e-mail and back-channel possibilities also exist. Ideally, a promotional strategy should be blind to channel distinctions, because all channels can contribute to e-commerce exposure in today's multichannel selling universe. In short, small companies should develop a portfolio of promotional initiatives that complement each other. "Specialized niche audiences are served by specific targeted media," the Yankee Group's Kishore noted, pointing to "e-mail newsletters, certain chat rooms, specific Web sites [and] printed magazines" as possible venues for advertising. Affiliations One concept from the bubble years that has become more important in the post-bubble era is strategic partnering. Amazon is doing it. EBay is doing it. Small businesses can do it, too. According to Kishore, the preliminary work of building an affiliate relationship involves identifying potential partners that will benefit the business the most. "Partner with sites that have high traffic," Kishore advised. Bulk traffic is as important as exact match-ups between partners. Again, cross-channel thinking is crucial. "Don't ignore the brick-and-mortar environment," Kishore noted. "You can partner with a physical retail outlet." Paying the Search Engines Another method of gaining notice that has soared in popularity recently involves placing ads on online search engines. These sites, most prominently Google, feature targeted advertising next to search results of predetermined keywords. The cost of buying paid search hits is controlled to some extent through an automated auction process that gives the top spot to the highest bidder. The advertiser pays only for click-throughs, elevating the efficiency of this type of advertising. "You get a load of recognition for a reasonable price," IDC's Gaw told the E-Commerce Times. "You might not have a big budget, but for a while, at least, you can outbid Amazon." An added (and free) benefit of buying search results is sheer exposure -- your name appears fairly prominently even when viewers do not click through. In traditional advertising, such an "impression" would be billed. Although purchased search results are all the rage, traditional online directories should not be disregarded, either. Helen Chan, a senior analyst with the Yankee Group who specializes in SMB (small and medium business) e-commerce, emphasized the importance of finding directories that match your product category or even geographical location. "Find the appropriate vertical directories, not just the generic listings," she told the E-Commerce Times. Making Connections Chan, who wrote a recent Yankee Group study called "SMBs and E-Commerce: Strategies for Success," also said small e-commerce ventures should look beyond the dry metrics of dollars and eyeballs. "It's all about building connections," she noted. She rattled off a quick inventory of basic approaches that should be undertaken by any small site. "Provide links in partner sites. Cross-leverage traffic. Integrate with every part of the business process. Get that site in front of existing customers. Include the site in existing marketplaces like eBay or Yahoo! Shopping." Crucial to small-business e-commerce success, according to Chan, is keeping customers interested after the first visit. To that end, communication and personalization features are imperative. They not only make a site more engaging, but also open the door to more alluring advertisements. "The more customers expect interactivity at the site, the more they'll visit it," Chan noted. Chan's published report identified this bundle of "behavioral" factors as the most crucial determinant of e-commerce success for small enterprises. The Upshot In a sense, for small businesses, bad news is good news. "There's not very much capital in the market today," Kishore said. "The formula of heavy marketing, coupled with the hope of reaching critical mass, is not an option any longer." With the competitive scramble for venture capital also a distant memory, small e-commerce projects can launch into a relatively level playing field. Of course, small companies must dig their trenches far from the giant footprints of big-name online destinations. But with everybody in partnering mode, even the smallest operation stands a chance of affiliating with a larger e-tailer. The real progress in SMB e-commerce is made by companies with imagination. Great targeting can easily make up for a modest budget, leading the way to e-commerce success.

I'm finding the biggest challenge to be the marketing which from what I read, should be no surprise to you. I have my own website, but I don't know how to get search engines to display it. Also, what's the best way to charge for work? Credit card, check, PayPal? Any advice would be great. Thanks! Jason Russell Reply Re: How Small Sites Can Get Noticed sawdustart Posted 2003-03-20 Dear Brad Hill, I spend all my time when I read this marketing stuff and getting new software stuff being exasperated because I am not as able as that. My qualities lay elsewhere. I always have wondered why marketers and management advisers talk the talk with no comprehension about time management. For artists a working day never gets fulfilled and that is without marketing and so on. Does it not appear so that someone like me needs a connected interested party who can succeed in getting me and therefore them income? That is team effort. I am a specialist with special concerns and problems including disabilities. Only got two hands.>>allen Reply Re: How Small Sites Can Get Noticed TheInitiative Posted 2003-04-02 sawdustart, as a new partner in a small pottery company I understand exactly. I am an Internet applications computer programmer by day, and am now creating an ecommerce site for our pottery company as my second job. I was surprised to discover that online marketing is a very complex issue. For example, one note that I saw nobody else mention is that you can unknowingly add things to your site that get you blacklisted by search engines. This, and a thousand other issues, make online marketing daunting even for an Internet professional. For my pottery company I'm responsible for all ecommerce tasks, so I'm becoming something of an expert with online marketing techniques. And it's no easy task, as you're finding out. But I find it very interesting as a computer professional and now a small business person. ...

Firstly optimizating a website is a complex subject, but with minor changes significant improvement can be made at no cost. The success of an optimized webpage depends on three factors: 1) The HTML code structure for your webpages 2) The No. of incoming links to your website 3) The competitiveness of the keyphrase you are optimizing for. If its too competitive, then you have little chance, or if it is not competitive, then you may end up with a webpage optimized for a keyphrase that no one really searches for. There needs to be a balance somewhere in the middle. I had a look at the link popularity website <a href="http://www.linkpopularity.com">http://www.linkpopularity.com</a> and found ...

I've had over 50000 unique visitors so far with only 100 customers. With this conversion rate there is no point doing business if not for wholesale buyers. I think internet is yet to mature in terms of online sales but it's a great way to drive business through exposure to "other" buyers out there.

Thanks AP Reply Re: How Small Sites Can Get Noticed Phenom Posted 2003-08-27 It sounds like everyone is interested in SPECIFICS, so I will share some practical knowledge with interested readers. When most people think about getting their website noticed, they think about ranking well in the search engines. The importance of ranking well cannot be understated -- since people who enter keywords into Google, find a site, and then visit that site are essentially pre-qualified customers. That is, they have already stated an interest in what your website offers. But how do you get to the top of the list? The short answer is good text on your webpages and good links to your site. And by "good" I mean text pages that the search engines (the most important being Google) will decide are most relevant for a given set of search criteria. This of course begs the question ...

Reply Re: How Small Sites Can Get Noticed FindGift-com Posted 2003-03-19 sawdustart - Getting the most for your money is the secret to starting small and getting bigger. In order to do this, you need a way to track the success of your marketing programs. I am continuously surprised by the number of companies that do not know their return revenue on their marketing programs. Not having this information leaves you in the dark. Once you have this tracking system in place, then you can make small marketing experiments. Spend more money on the marketing sources that provide you with the best return revenue relative to money spent. I'd start by getting good placements in the search engines for keyword terms that are highly targeted to what you do. Getting high placement for "Art" would be great. Though, that is a highly competitive term and would be difficult to ...
