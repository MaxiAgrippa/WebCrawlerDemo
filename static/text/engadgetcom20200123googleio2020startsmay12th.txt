Richard Lawler, @Rjcc 01.23.20 Comments 168 Shares Share Tweet Share Sponsored Links ASSOCIATED PRESS Now that enough people have completed a special puzzle, Google announced that its annual developer event will return to the Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View. Google I/O will run from May 12th - 14th, a few days later than its timing in 2019. In the past we've seen announcements focusing on everything from Assistant to Google Glass, and who knows what 2020 may bring to the location's outdoor stage. (Other than Android, AI and other usual service enhancements, of course.) Cosmos aligned. We'll be back at Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View for this year's #GoogleIO on May 12-14! pic.twitter.com/3bZqriaoi1 — Sundar Pichai (@sundarpichai) January 24, 2020 In this article: business, gear, google, google io, google io 2020, Sundar Pichai All products recommended by Engadget are selected by our editorial team, independent of our parent company.
