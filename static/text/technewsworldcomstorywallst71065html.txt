Download Reimagining Commerce now to get an exclusive look at successful retail strategies in 2020. Apple broke a slew of records in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2010, hitting new levels for iPhone and Mac sales, quarterly revenue and earnings and retail store earnings, its executives announced during the company's earnings call Monday. Further, sales of the iPad are humming along, there are now 300,000 apps in the iTunes App Store, and enterprises are beginning to fall in love with the iPad and iPhone. Chief Financial Officer Peter Oppenheimer said the company could have sold even more iPhones if it had them to hand. He also disclosed that half the in-store purchasers of Macs were new customers. Sales in China are doing well, he added, and he expressed confidence about the future. So why was CEO Steve Jobs ranting about Android for perhaps 10 minutes? Does that signal that perhaps Android might be perceived as a significant challenger, or was Jobs just setting things up so that Google would gain enough confidence to become an easy mark? Apple's Hallelujah Chorus Apple's revenue for Q4 2010 was US$23.4 billion -- more than $8.4 billion over that of the previous quarter. This came primarily from record iPhone sales and very strong sales of the iPad and iMac. Customers snapped up 3.9 million Macs, over 400,000 more than the previous quarter, giving the Mac line a 27 percent year over year growth rate compared to 11 percent for the market overall. Apple sold 14.1 million iPhones, 91 percent more than the 7.4 million sold in the same quarter of last year. This translated to $8.6 billion in dollar terms. Oppenheimer was "very pleased" with customer demand for iPhones in China. We could go on and on, but you get the drift. Mucho dinero. Muy feliz. Then Jobs spoke up, tromped verbally all over RIM and let fly a few salvos aimed at Android. Que te Pasa, Senor Jobs? "Last week [Google CEO] Eric Schmidt reiterated they're activating 200,000 Android devices a day and have around 90,000 apps in their app store," Jobs said. "Apple has activated about 200,000 iOS devices a day for the past 30 days, peaking at 300,000 on some of those days. Apple has 300,000 apps in its app store." Jobs went on to claim that there's no solid data on just how many Android phones are shipped in each quarter; characterized Google's Android as fragmented rather than open source; asserted that the so-called avalanche of Android tablets poised to roar into the market is only a trickle; and warned Android tablet manufacturers to beware of Google's plans. Jobs said a lot more -- but that's not important; what we as investors need to figure out is, why did he make a special appearance to trumpet the puissance of the iPad and tongue-lash the competition? Uneasy Lies the Head Well, it's true that Apple's currently king of the tablet computer hill -- but Google could be treading on its heels, which may be why Jobs popped up at the earnings call to put in his two cents. "Android will be adapted further for tablets even as Android 2.2 will be used by Samsung's Galaxy tablet," Chris Hazelton, a research director at the 451 Group, told MacNewsWorld. "This offers Google the opportunity to push its own services into the enterprise, which is a threat to Apple." Further, the fragmentation in Android devices occurs mainly for gaming apps, Ramon Llamas, a senior research analyst at IDC, told MacNewsWorld. "Other than that, it's a standard experience from one Android phone to the next," he added. The fragmentation in the Android market is only a temporary phenomenon, Maribel Lopez, founder of and principal analyst at Lopez Research, told MacNewsWorld. "Right now, Android has to move quickly because it has to catch up -- the features are a moving target, and every three months there's something big being introduced. That will start to settle out, and Android will become a more stable system maybe in a year from now." That could be why Jobs focused his remarks mainly on Android at the earnings call. "The real issue is that, in Jobs' mind, Android is the competition right now," Lopez said. Investors Bruise Apple Perhaps Jobs' verbal attack on Android was spurred by a pain deep in his wallet. Apple's profit margins slid from their phenomenally healthy Q4, 2009 level of 41.8 percent to 36.9 percent for Q4 2010. That five percent drop, while still the envy of the rest of the electronics industry, seems to have angered investors, who promptly punished Cupertino in the best way they know how -- they began selling off their Apple stock. Apple's share prices fell by as much as $15 in volatile pre-market trading. They recovered somewhat later, but at press time, they were still somewhat depressed, standing at $309.50, down $8.50. Pushing Through the Pain Before you leap to the phone and begin bellowing at your broker to sell AAPL, note that Apple hit $300 only last week, and that was a record high. Recall that Apple's pretty optimistic about the next quarter. With the company's history of downplaying earnings guidelines, perhaps that was cause to click one's heels and do a couple of backflips. In a muted way, of course. Further, both Oppenheimer and Jobs stated repeatedly that profit margins are slipping because they've priced the iPhone and iPad aggressively. Reading between the lines, that means Apple's seizing market share at the expense of a small slide in profit margins, which it might more than make up for later as new customers get hooked and begin purchasing other Apple wares or upgrading their existing devices. "Apple's retail partnerships will allow it to pursue a broad-based iPad distribution strategy to get it in front of as many holiday shoppers as possible short term, and to keep it in front of mass market and other consumers longer term," Susan Kevorkian, a research director at IDC, told MacNewsWorld. She predicted that 13.1 million media tablets would be shipped worldwide this year. Yes indeed, and with Apple being king of the hill, it won't take much of a stretch of the imagination to figure out who's going to get the lion's share of those sales. In a note to investors, Brian Marshall, an analyst at Gleacher, says the "knee jerk" reaction to news of a profit margin slide is wrong. He urged investors to view Apple's earnings more holistically. Marshall has reiterated his buy rating on AAPL stock and raised his price target from $345 to $355.
