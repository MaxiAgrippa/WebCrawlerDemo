The star of the show was Ballie, a robotic sphere with a passing resemblance to a volleyball. It’s fused with Samsung’s artificial intelligence tech, meaning it can identify people, stream live video, and operate various smart home gadgets like lighting, smart TVs, and even a Roomba. It’s somewhere between a Star Wars droid or perhaps real-life company Sphero’s very own discontinued BB-8 toy and the ill-fated Cozmo robot from defunct startup Anki. Hopefully, Samsung’s Ballie fares better than those two droids. From there, Samsung’s press conference veered off into a meandering series of tech demos and high-level concepts, including an augmented reality demo featuring its GEMS exoskeleton from last year’s CES and new AR glasses that combine with a virtual personal trainer for full-body fitness applications. There were also discussions on “smart kitchen” concepts, talk of smart cities, and new cutting-edge firefighter and health care tech. It’s a lot to take in, but thankfully, we’ve broken out the most interesting moments in the video above.
