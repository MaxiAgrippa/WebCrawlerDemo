Slava Tyukalov Their latest entry is a handmade optical mouse from designer Slava Tyukalov, who says his wireless creation is made from materials similar to those used by space agencies to form a "graphite-aluminum composite metal matrix" wrapped in high-grade Italian leather. According to his blog, the "Cold Steel" version pictured here goes for $397, though he stresses that demand is high (the Russians have discovered the wonders of capitalism, after all). For collectors looking for something even more exotic, Electronista says his signature GoldenEye model is covered in snakeskin.
