Mello Jr. May 5, 2015 10:18 AM PT Webinar: Unlocking the Potential of Password Vault Alternatives Understanding the differing Privileged Access Management solutions can be a challenge, especially for Linux of UNIX environments. Learn how to create a more comprehensive security approach by examining the different approaches of password vaults and privilege management during this webinar. Drive-by attacks on the Internet are a particularly pernicious form of online threat, especially for individual Web surfers. On the corporate level, though, a company with good endpoint protection software can foil the malicious practice. A drive-by occurs when an infected website automatically downloads malware onto a Net traveler's computer. Several companies make endpoint solutions to -- among other things -- thwart those kinds of attacks. NSS Labs recently tested 10 of them. "The exploitation of software vulnerabilities is one of the most common and effective cyber attacks that enterprises face today. Commonly known as drive-by exploits, these attacks silently compromise a victim's computer without the user being aware," notes the firm's report. "Drive-by exploits have become a favored tool of cyber criminals and other threat actors," it continues. "Endpoint protection (EPP) products must provide robust defenses against these threats." Top finishers in the testing were endpoint products made by F-Secure, Symantec and Kaspersky, which blocked 100 percent of the drive-by attacks hurled at them. Importance of Consistency A factor that distinguished the top products from their peers was good URL reputation analysis. "Products without a great reputation system in place have had an issue with drive-by exploits," said Bhaarath Venkateswaran, a practice manager at NSS Labs. "Products with great URL reputation typically did well in this test." With a good reputation system, bad websites can be blacklisted by an endpoint product. "It can take action right away just by looking at the URL," Venkateswaran told TechNewsWorld. "It's stage one protection, so it blocks the site before it can drop anything on the user's machine." Another area where the top products shone was in consistency. "The crimeware ecosystem is highly commoditized and will repeatedly attack day after day after day. A good security product needs to be consistently ready," explained Sean Sullivan, a security researcher with F-Secure Labs. "On the other side of things, persistent attackers will readily take advantage of any gaps if present," he told TechNewsWorld. "Time means nothing to crimeware botnets pounding away -- and persistent attackers will devote time, if needed. So consistency of protection over time is indeed important." Better endpoint products also make good use of the cloud. "Products with real-time cloud features can be far more aggressive in making decisions," Sullivan said. "With real-time look-ups, cloud-security products can determine if suspicious files are unique -- and if so -- treat them with the suspicion that they deserve." C Is for Culpable When a data breach occurs, you likely won't find security pros pointing fingers at anyone but themselves. That was what Tripwire discovered when it polled attendees at two security conferences held last month in San Francisco -- the RSA conference and B-Sides San Francisco. When asked, "Who would be held responsible in the wake of a data breach on critical infrastructure in your organization," 41 percent of the 250 infosec pros surveyed said CIO, CISO or CSO. The response didn't vary much when the question changed to who should be held responsible: Thirty-five percent said CIO, CISO or CSO. Only a small number of the conferees felt the CEO (18 percent) or the board (10 percent) should be on the hook for a data breach. It could be that security pros are more willing to eschew fingerpointing because they're increasingly getting a seat at the C table. "We're seeing more demand for that," said Ken Westin, a senior security researcher at Tripwire. "A lot of times the CISO will report to the CFO because they speak the language of risk. As long as a CISO knows how to speak the language of business and business risk, he should be at the table," he told TechNewsWorld. "It's also a sign of security in general," Westin added. "It's moving beyond the technical things in the trenches and bringing out the impact of risk." Conference Room Robbers Ever wonder what the chances are you'll get your cellphone back if you lose it? WinMagic has, and it decided to experiment with the idea last month, during the week that infosec pros congregated at the RSA conference in San Francisco. The company began "losing" phones at the conference and at venues around it. What did it find? Overall, you have a little better than 50 percent chance of getting your phone back if you lose it (53 percent of the phones were returned to their owners). The best place to lose a phone? A bar -- 100 percent of the phones left in bars were returned to their owners. The worst place? A conference room -- none of those phones were returned to their owners. Breach Diary April 28.
