Drip coffee makers are supposed to be dead simple: fill with give them grounds, top with hot water and then let time and gravity work its magic. Even though this sounds easy, it's actually not because most drip coffee makers don't get water hot enough or brew too slowly, which makes them fail miserably at the basic task of the drip. Others tend to overcompensate, and end up scalding their coffee grounds completely. Luckily, there are noteworthy exceptions, and whether you prefer to brew perfect lattes, iced coffee or a cup of freshly ground coffee, you don't need to spend a mint to get the best coffee maker. You can drop over $600 on a tricked-out Ratio Eight that's as beautiful as it is capable or on a programmable commercial coffee maker. But all it takes is $15 to get Oxo's superb Single Serve Pour Over funnel. And there are plenty of compelling choices in-between for your brew. One is our Editors' Choice winner, the Bonavita Connoisseur, our pick for best all-around automatic brewer. Another is the KitchenAid Siphon Brewer, which uses an ancient technique to achieve outstanding and dramatic results. No matter your budget, there's something on this list that'll fit your drip needs perfectly and be the best coffee maker for you -- and we'll periodically update it with new products as we test them. We promise, you'll never have to drink coffee from pods again. The best all-round coffee maker Bonavita Connoisseur Chris Monroe/CNET Despite its snobby name, the Connoisseur from Bonavita is the best coffee maker for automatic drip coffee you can buy for the least amount of cash.

Read our Oxo Cold Brew Coffee Maker review. $49 at Amazon The best value Oxo Good Grips Pour-Over Tyler Lizenby/CNET Great tasting drip from a product that costs just $15? It sounds unlikely but that's just what the affordable Oxo Good Grips Pour-Over offers. It only makes coffee one drink at a time, and requires you to provide the hot water. That said, the simple brewer transforms the otherwise complex task of pour-over into one that's easy, clean and almost foolproof.

Read our Ratio Eight review. $495 at Ratio Coffee The best for traditionalists Techivorm Moccamaster KBT 741 Megan Wollerton/CNET Dutch company Technivorm has sold exceptionally good drip coffee makers for decades. Its Moccamaster KBT 741 sports a design with clean lines and sharp angles that harkens back to 1968, the year the first Moccamaster hit stores. Retro design aside, the Moccamaster KBT 741 consistently puts out perfect freshly brewed coffee that will satisfy coffee connoisseurs. It's stainless steel thermal carafe also keeps its contents hot a full six hours. Read our Technivorm Moccamaster KBT 741 review. $309 at Amazon A note on testing coffee makers Evaluating the performance of a coffee maker is trickier than it might sound. The first step is to know what good drip coffee actually is. According to the Specialty Coffee Association, there are criteria critical to brewing quality java. Mainly these are brewing time and water temperature. Hot water should come into contact with grounds for no less than four minutes and no longer than eight. Additionally, the ideal water temperature range is between 197 degrees Fahrenheit (92C) and 205 degrees Fahrenheit (96C). To confirm how each coffee maker meets that challenge, we log the length of their brew cycles. We also employ thermocouple heat sensors connected to industrial-grade data loggers. That enables us to record the temperature within the coffee grounds while brewing is underway. Enlarge Image We measure the temperature inside the brewing chamber of every coffee maker we test. Brian Bennett/CNET After brewing coffee, we take sample readings of the produced coffee liquid with an optical refractometer. Given we factor in the amount of water and freshly ground coffee used, that data lets us calculate the Total Dissolved Solids percentage of each brew. From there we arrive at the extraction percentage. The ideal range is commonly thought to be between 18 and 20%. We also back up measured data with a good, old fashioned taste test. If the taste of a cup of coffee is bitter, there's a good chance it was over extracted during the drip. On the opposite end, an under extracted cup of coffee will typically taste weak -- it can even taste sour or have the flavor of soggy peanuts. And to be certain, we brew identical test runs a minimum of three times to achieve average results.
