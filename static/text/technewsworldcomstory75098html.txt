Deveau • CRM Buyer • ECT News Network May 14, 2012 5:00 AM PT Curious about the ROI of PIM? Hear Amanda LeClair from Forrester Research and Elizabeth Haubenreiser from Zurn Industries discuss the value of PIM and how it impacts the entire customer journey. Watch the on-demand webinar and discover what PIM can do for your business. CRMC (Customer Relationship Management Conference) is being held May 29 to 31 at the Chicago Hyatt Regency. This annual event offers a unique agenda for retailers, Devon Wylie, CEO of CRMC told CRM Buyer. "It's specifically focused on case studies from topnotch multinational retailers. With this approach, attendees can get actionable learnings they can take home with them." The conference will offer three streams: basic loyalty and strategy; analytics implementation; and social and mobile. "Social and mobile is a new piece," Wylie said. "While we have touched on it in the past, this year it's hitting mainstream." Walgreens, GameStop, Express, Best Buy, Bass Pro Shops and Groupon are among the retailers who will be participating in the event. Soraya Daraby, cofounder of Foodspotting and digital strategist for ABC News, is scheduled to deliver a keynote speech at the conference on "The ROI of Social Media for Today's Retail Brands: How to Make It Work for Your Business." Loyalty specialist Kobie Marketing will also be leading a roundtable discussion on "The Best Technology to Drive Customer Engagement & Generate Measurable Results." The focus of the discussion will be on understanding and delivering an effective customer experience in retail with a particular focus on integration approaches. "Retail channels have evolved over the years to include mobile, tablets and integration with social media platforms," Michael Hemsey, president of Kobie, told CRM Buyer. "It's well beyond someone liking you as a brand. Now you have to engage with customers and create customer experience management strategies through those channels to differentiate yourself over the long term," he said. "You also have to know how to monetize those behaviors by tying them to your offline programs to drive new relationships." Kobie will be releasing a new white paper, "Omnichannel Loyalty: Designing the Ultimate Consumer Experience," on its website at the end of this month. Zoho Support Integrates With Twitter, Facebook Zoho Support now offers tight integration with Twitter and Facebook.

I'm looking forward to seeing the news that comes out of this show. It's great to see the new focus being placed on mobile and social -- retailers need to stay on top of consumers' use of such technology, and how it relates to their CRM systems. It's an approach we use to inform the design of our RQ and XQ product lines: http://www.iqmetrix.com/products Reply Related Stories How Outside Experts Can Refine the Customer Experience Apr 17, 2012 The Insurgents and the Status Quo Mar 21, 2012 New App Boosts Epicor's Tablet Chops in Retail Setting Jan 27, 2012 News Alerts CRM Activate Alert | Search Archives Best Buy Activate Alert | Search Archives Social media Activate Alert | Search Archives Twitter Activate Alert | Search Archives Facebook Activate Alert | Search Archives LinkedIn Activate Alert | Search Archives Cisco Systems Activate Alert | Search Archives Create Your Own News Alerts More in Call Centers Making Customers the Object of Devotion inContact Smooths the Way for Better Customer Interactions The Advent of Digital Customer Relationships Predictive Analytics Digs Deeper Into CRM Forging Strong Links in Your Customer Interaction Chains Workforce Management Gets Intelligence Boost View All More by Denise J.

It would compromise the delivery of critical health information. It would impair the operations of providers of needed services. People would not be able to order goods online. The damage to the global economy would be incalculable. Many people would not be able to communicate with loved ones and friends. It would make working from home impossible. Loss of entertainment options could threaten mental health.
