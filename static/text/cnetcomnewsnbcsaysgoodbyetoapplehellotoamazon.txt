Greg Sandoval September 15, 2007 7:34 AM PDT NBC Universal didn't waste any time replacing Apple. Episodes of The Office and Heroes will begin appearing at Amazon's Unbox starting next Monday, according to a statement released by the companies. Amazon customers can download the pilot shows for new series, such as Bionic Woman, and Chuck, free of charge and in advance of their network premiers. Other shows will be available on Amazon Unbox the day after they air. Amazon and NBC Universal are offering a range of packages, including a 30 percent off deal when purchasing a complete season in advance. NBC Universal and Apple engaged in a public relations battle last week. The spat started when NBC announced it would not renew a long-term contract to offer TV shows for download on iTunes because Apple wasn't offering favorable enough terms. In response, Apple said it wouldn't sell NBC's shows for the upcoming season.
