Dan Ackerman June 13, 2007 9:30 AM PDT It was only last week that we saw details on Dell's fancy new 13-inch XPS laptop leaked. If Dell has one new laptop coming out, surely they must have more, right? Apparently the entire Inspiron line is getting a major makeover, according to the scuttlebutt on French Dell fan site (seriously) LesDelliens.com. The folks over at Engadgethave helpfully grabbed some of the details and translated the pages via Babelfish. The current Inspiron 1505 and 1705 will be replaced by the 1520, 1521, 1720, and 1721, plus a new 14-inch 1420. The "20" models are all Intel Santa Rosa systems, all the way up to the 2.2GHz T7500, while the "21" models have AMD CPUs, topping out at the 2.2GHz AMD Turion 64 X2 TL-64. You can also expect 802.11n and Blu-ray drives as an option in most of these laptops. lesdelliens.com From the pics we've seen online, the traditionally dowdy Inspiron line has gotten a bit of a makeover, and there seems to be a nice range of color options, including pink, red, green, and yellow. No word on pricing or release dates yet, but stay tuned.
