Brian Bennett February 26, 2012 7:52 AM PST Richard Yu, chairman of Huawei devices, introducing the Ascend D Quad at Mobile World Congress 2012. Marguerite Reardon/CNET Huawei's speedy Ascend D Quad phone debuts (photos) 6 Photos Surprise, surprise. It turns out the first quad-core smartphones to be announced at Mobile World Congress aren't powered by Nvidia's vaunted Tegra 3 chip. Instead, Huawei's D Quad line will feature quad-core silicon specially made by Huawei called the K3V2. Huawei Chairman Richard Yu took the stage at the MWC show in Barcelona, Spain, to tout the impressive abilities of the company's flagship model, the Ascend D Quad. Other internal hardware includes a big 4.5-inch 720p HD screen, Dolby 5.1 surround sound audio, plus an 8-megapixel rear- and 1.3-megapixel front-facing camera. Huawei's top devices of MWC 2012 (photos) 12 Photos Other handsets in the line include the Ascend Quad XL and Ascend D1. The Quad XL will have a massive 2,500mAh battery, but the same specs as the D Quad. The D1, on the other hand, will be powered by a 1.5GHz dual-core CPU and 1,670mAh battery.

All three phones will have Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich. Yu also claimed that the Ascend Quad D, powered by an 1,800mAh battery, will provide 30 percent more run time than average mobile devices. Yu also said that the Ascend D Quad is much faster, too- 20 percent to 30 percent faster, in fact, than one running the Tegra 3. That's a bold statement. We'll have to wait a while before testing this boast since the phone is expected to ship in April. No price yet, but the Ascend Quad D will be sold in Europe, North and South America, plus the Middle East.
