StackCommerce 03.29.20 Comments Share Tweet Share Sponsored Links Being forced to work at home and away from your office and all of its various amenities can be tricky, to say the least. Instead of a quiet room and a large monitor on a wide desk, you're now likely surrounded by your loving-yet-incredibly-loud family and forced to work exclusively from a humble laptop. So in order to make your transition to that ad hoc home office just a bit easier, we've rounded up three incredibly powerful Audio-Technica headphones that will help you work distraction-free while streaming your favorite music. 1. Audio-Technica ATH-ANC70 QuietPoint Active Noise-Cancelling Headphones (Certified Refurbished) MSRP: $60 | Sale Price: $50 (16 percent off) Drown out all that noise at home so you can listen and work in peace with these supremely comfortable, refurbished headphones, which offer active noise-cancellation technology along with HD audio and a 25-hour battery life. It's also easy to quickly connect these cans to all of your go-to devices thanks to the latest Bluetooth technology, and a foldable design along with an included carrying case means that you'll be able to toss these headphones in your bag without worry. 2. Audio-Technica Wireless Over-Ear Hi-Res Headphones MSRP: $169 | Sale Price: $102 (40 percent off) Perfect for serious listeners who don't want to drop an absurd amount of money on a pair of HD headphones, these over-ear high-resolution headphones offer extraordinary sound and comfort without breaking the bank.

Audio-Technica ATH-ANC7bSV QuietPoint® Headphones - Black/Silver (Certified Refurbished) MSRP: $200 | Sale Price: $70 (65 percent off) Built with the frequent traveler in mind but just as helpful for working at home surrounded by loud family madness, these headphones effectively reduce distracting background noise by over 90% while offering the superior audio quality that one expects from Audio-Technica.
