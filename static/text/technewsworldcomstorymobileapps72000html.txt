Absolutely. Hear experts from Forrester Research and Zurn Industries explain how the value of PIM goes beyond operational efficiencies and share why product content is critical for delivering a great customer experience. Watch the webinar. Apps come and go, as any iOS user knows, but everyone has core apps tucked away that get consistent use. When it comes to the land of movies, there are three apps that stand head and shoulders above the rest: IMDb, Flixster, and Netflix. For me, these three apps actually get used consistently. IMDb stands for The Internet Movie database.Database, and online it offers up details on almost every modern movie ever made, including synopsis, directors, stars/cast, writers, opening weekend, gross profits, overall budget, soundtracks, trivia and so much more. If you want to know which movie star played that kick-butt supporting role in "The Town" alongside Ben Affleck, IMDb is your go-to app. Flixster has a lot of information about movies and the people who make them too, but its core focus -- particularly for me -- comes back to dates, times and reviews. Want to know the release date for "Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides?" I turn to Flixster (May 20, BTW). Better still is checking out the latest DVD releases, along with their reviews to give you an idea which ones are worth your time to actually watch. And speaking of watching, the Netflix iOS app works surprisingly well for streaming movies. Of course, Netflix's online library doesn't usually contain hot new releases, but there are plenty of excellent movies available to keep you occupied. If you've got an Apple TV, shelling out for a Netflix account can be a particularly worthwhile option. Cinematic Know-It-All IMDb, an app from the company of the same name, is available for free at the App Store. IMDb The IMDb is a big database full of cross-referenced movie and TV-focused details, and while it might not have comprehensive information on every single star, it's pretty freaking amazing and usually delivers. The app assumes that you're coming to it looking for something in particular, so the very top of the app's home screen has a search field. Handy. In the iOS app, if you're interested in keeping up with movie industry news, the app's home screen also shows the top news of the day. Tap to dive in, and you'll get a scrollable list that also usually shows head shot photos of the stars the articles discuss. Next, the Showtimes feature lets you enter in a ZIP code or use built-in location services to generate a list of movie showtimes and locations. I don't really think of IMDb for immediate movie action, but it's part of the app. The Movie section lets you drill down into the latest movies, with related links for those that are coming soon, for U.S. box office results, what's new on DVD and Blu-ray, or what's trending lately in user interest. There are similar features for TV, and if you're gaga over movie stars, you can follow the "STARmeter" for the actors that getting all the attention lately. If you create an account and sign into IMDb, you can also rate movies, with additional features on the Web, such creating and managing movie lists, getting personalized movie showtimes, or discussing movie stuff on the IMDb message boards. Basically, it all comes down to this: IMDb is free, and you want it on your phone. What to Watch? Flixter, an app from the company of the same name, is available for free at the App Store. Flixter Flixster is another great movie action app, and it's best use is learning about new movies that you really want to see. It's a great app for helping you make decisions, both for new movies and those out on DVD (or presumably available to rent digitally). What makes Flixster particularly great isn't the easy access to movie trailers, showtimes, and movie theaters in your immediate area or home neighborhood. What makes Flixster worth 5 out of 5 stars is its integration with Rotten Tomatoes' reviews and ratings. Each movie gets the familiar red tomato rating with a percentage next to it -- or the green splat icon for those movies that fall below 50 percent approval ratings. If you appreciate Rotten Tomatoes, Flixster is an app you need to download and install. Still, Flixster users get ratings, too, and these are shown next to the Rotten Tomatoes ratings. "Hall Pass," for example, scored a rotten 34 percent (splat) while 70 percent of Flixster users said they liked it. Check out a few movies, and you're own cinema sensibilities will align with the genres and types of movies you're looking at, and you'll be able to trust one of the two ratings in most situations. The BlockBuster Buster Netflix, an app from the company of the same name, is available for free at the App Store. A Netflix account is required; rates start at US$7.99 per month. Netflix For actually kicking back and watching a movie -- rather than learning all about them -- Netflix is hard to beat. While the Netflix app is free on your iPhone or any iOS device, you still need an account with Netflix in order to stream movies and television shows. It costs $7.99 for streaming, and for $9.99, you can also rent a single DVD at a time. Most of the movies available for streaming are older, but some are newer releases. It's not often that the hottest box office movies come to Netflix for streaming, but that's not necessarily Netflix's fault: I'm sure the movie studios and rights holders are looking for more profitable distribution methods through direct rentals and DVD sales. Either way, if you like movies, odds are, you'll find enough to watch to justify your $7.99 investment. If you like TV shows and want to catch up on older seasons, it's tough to be the value proposition of Netflix. But how is the quality? Streaming quality has been surprisingly good on my iPhone 4, but it does depend on the quality of your WiFi signal and network speed. But get this: One night I had a movie keep breaking up on me, so I turned off WiFi on my iPhone 4 entirely, and continued watching over my AT&T 3G cellular service connection. Quality actually improved! I'm one of the holdouts with the original unlimited data downloads from AT&T (rather than a 2GB limit), so this isn't particularly dangerous for me. If you are on a limited data plan and start streaming a new TV show every lunch hour in the employee break room, you might want to stick with WiFi. Netflix doesn't have queue management built into the app, so that's a bummer if you also rent DVDs. Overall, though, particularly if you have a new Netflix-capable device attached to your HDTV, Netflix is a worthy app to invest in.

It would compromise the delivery of critical health information. It would impair the operations of providers of needed services. People would not be able to order goods online. The damage to the global economy would be incalculable. Many people would not be able to communicate with loved ones and friends. It would make working from home impossible.
