Mello Jr. May 12, 2016 12:43 PM PT 2020 online shopping habits and retailer strategies For the fourth year in a row, Episerver has surveyed over 4,000 global online shoppers to learn about their ecommerce expectations and habits. Download Reimagining Commerce now to get an exclusive look at successful retail strategies in 2020. The daily barrage of data breach news appears to be eroding confidence in security solutions. Fifty percent of IT pros aren't confident about the ability of their security measures to protect their data, according to a survey released last week by Barkly. The high percentage of IT pros with doubts about their security systems caught Barkly CTO Jack Danahy off-guard. "Organizations are investing because they know they should be doing something for security, but their expectations are low," he told TechNewsWorld. "For me that was a surprise because in most areas of business, people know what they're paying for, so they have reasonable expectations that something is going to be an enhancement to their business," he continued. Measuring Difficulties When asked whether their organizations could measure the return on investment of their security solutions, 54 percent of respondents weren't confident at all they could do that, according to the survey of 350 IT pros. "Security can be difficult to understand. It's not as easily measurable as other parts of their business," Danahy said. "In security, you're trying to stop something, as opposed to doing something. That makes it hard to quantify the return that you're getting for the investments that you're making," he noted. "The difficulty of creating a linear equation between the amount that I'm investing and the protection that I can prove that I'm getting makes it hard for people to be comfortable about whether they're budgeting either enough or too much for security," Danahy added. Hype Cycle Confidence in security solutions may be affected by the gap between what the solutions promise and what they deliver. "The problem is you've got a bunch of venture capitalists backing a bunch of technologies with a lot of money that the companies are spending on marketing rather than product development," maintained John Prisco, CEO of Triumfant. In the endpoint security space alone, there are more than 50 companies competing for business. "Many of them use some form of list or signature to protect endpoints, so a lot of those programs don't work when it comes down to a sophisticated adversary," he told TechNewsWorld. "The type of products that do work have artificial intelligence engines built into them, but the ones that are the most popular use lists and have the money to spend on ads on drive-time radio," Prisco said. "A lot of money is being spent, and there's a lot of hype from vendors around their products helping with security problems," noted Eddie Schwartz, international vice president for ISACA. "Yet breaches continue to occur, and they're very public and they're very damaging," he told TechNewsWorld. "So if you're in the C-suite and someone comes asking for more money for security," Schwartz added, "you're going to ask if any of this stuff really works, and why should we continue to invest in this?" More Automation Needed Confidence in security solutions also is being eroded by IT pros feeling overwhelmed by security issues, maintained Ben Desjardins, director of security solutions for Radware. "The lack of confidence IT pros express about their security solutions is often a reflection of their growing sense that, as practitioners, they are falling behind the pace of change in the threat landscape," he told TechNewsWorld. In response to those changes, security pros pile more point products into their stack to address the latest trendy threat, adding complexity to security infrastructure management, and introducing more and more manual efforts to maintain protection from a threat landscape that is increasingly automated, Desjardins said. He called on cyberwarriors to put more trust in automated security solutions. "Introducing technologies that can automate protection from not just today's attacks, but previously unseen attacks, can not only increase the confidence level of IT pros, but also address three of the four concerns related to security's impact on productivity," Desjardins said.
