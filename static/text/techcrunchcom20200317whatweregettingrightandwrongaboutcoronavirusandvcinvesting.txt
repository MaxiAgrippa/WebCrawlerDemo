What we’re getting right and wrong about coronavirus and VC investing – TechCrunch What we’re getting right and wrong about coronavirus and VC investing Danny Crichton 2 weeks It has only been nine days since I wrote an overview of the state of VC investing during the rise of the novel coronavirus pandemic. And what a week it has been: The markets have triggered circuit breakers for an unprecedented third time, a global economic depression seems in the offing and the Trump administration is now proposing upwards of $1 trillion in fiscal stimulus on top of the Fed’s hundreds of billions of dollars in quantitative easing.
