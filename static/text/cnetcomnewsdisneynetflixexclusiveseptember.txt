Sean Hollister May 23, 2016 12:46 PM PDT Walt Disney Pictures "Star Wars," "Captain America," "The Jungle Book" and "Finding Dory" -- this September, Netflix will become the exclusive place to stream all of Disney's latest movies. It's a deal that's taken nearly four years to bear fruit. In 2012, Netflix and Disney said they'd reached an arrangement to make Netflix the exclusive US subscription television provider of first-run, live-action and animated feature films. (We wrote a huge FAQ on the subject.) But it's only today, buried in a Netflix press release, that we're learning September is the month when Disney, Marvel, Pixar and Lucasfilm's latest works will make it to Netflix. Until September, pay-TV channel Starz still has the rights to Disney's creations. While you wait, here's the full list of everything coming to Netflix in June 2016.
