Watch Now » What Open Source Can Learn From Steve Jobs, Part 1 The Fall of the House of Stallman The blind hatred of Free Software Foundation President Richard Stallman toward proprietary programs is such that he has given speeches in which he advocated for software piracy. Stallman wrote this the day after Steve Jobs died: "As Chicago Mayor Harold Washington said of the corrupt former Mayor Daley, 'I'm not glad he's dead, but I'm glad he's gone.'" If you were to take that as something a bitter loser would say, you'd be right. Stallman doesn't believe that programs should compete on either technical merit or on how much users like them. To the contrary, his speeches, which you can find on the FSF Europe website, contain material such as this: I'm all in favour of the principle that it's good to reward people who do things that contribute to society and it's good to punish people, one way or another, if they do things that harm society. This means that people who develop Free Software that's useful deserve a reward, and people who develop proprietary software that's attractive deserve a punishment. To Stallman, Jobs must have been a double helping of evil -- both Apple software and hardware must seem almost sinfully proprietary and attractive to him. Since his "Boycott Apple" campaign failed, and he can't convince people to change on technical merit or on the facts, what's left? How about propaganda? For those of us who had to read 1984 in school, the head of the Free Software Foundation sounds like he's channeling the Ministry of Truth. If you remember the party slogan "Freedom is Slavery," you might find this quote eerily similar: "It's a mistake to equate freedom to 'the freedom of choice.'" Most people would say that having freedom of choice is fundamental to exercising freedom. Taking away a choice, especially by demonizing those who offer choices you don't approve of, is usually associated with political or religious fanatics, not a meritocracy such as software. When your friend says 'that's a nice program, could I have a copy?' At that moment, you will have to choose between two evils. One evil is: give your friend a copy and violate the licence of the program. The other evil is: deny your friend a copy and comply with the licence of the program. Once you are in that situation, you should choose the lesser evil. The lesser evil is to give your friend a copy and violate the licence of the program. Whereas the developer of the program has deliberately attacked the social solidarity of your community. Deliberately tried to separate you from everyone else in the World. So if you can't help doing wrong in some direction or other, better to aim the wrong at somebody who deserves it, who has done something wrong, rather than at somebody who hasn't done anything wrong. This is the same childish "stick it to da man!" rationalization that kids use to justify everything from pirating music and movies to carjacking and robbing convenience stores. It's also an admission that you can't compete on either technical merit or execution. Recall how Jobs ended the demonization of Microsoft within Apple, got his people to focus on doing what Apple does best, and ended up with the most valuable company in the world? Contrast that with Stallman's approach, which is held by far too many, and helps explain why "GNU/linux" is still a rounding error in the desktop market. Negative campaigns turn people away. Nobody wants to hear about how "evil" their current software provider is. They want to hear what you can do better. Telling people they should pirate software not only makes Stallman look seedier than he already does -- it reflects badly on open source in general. Biting the Hand That Feeds Code Contributions This demonizing of programmers who write proprietary software for a living is not only silly, but also counterproductive. Many of those same programmers contribute to open source projects as part of their jobs; others do the same on their own time. Calling them "evil" or encouraging people to steal from them is only going to drive them away. Contrast this "steal from the evil programmer" attitude with how Steve Jobs treated his people. When he came back to Apple, Apple was beaten down, a loser. He pushed everyone hard to be the best they could, and in doing so, communicated the message "I'm pushing you hard because I know that together, we are going to be the best at what we do." It's one reason Apple held onto its talent despite offers of two and three times the pay. When people know you believe in them, not only can you push them harder -- they will push themselves harder. One long-term result has been that Apple survived long enough to contribute significant code back to the general software community, a practice that continues. A further problem is how quickly the community jumps on any imagined slight. Google hasn't yet released all of the source to the latest version of Android. It doesn't matter that it's not required to, and that it's already released the parts that it is required to -- people are still attacking Google. The fact that the third-party server at kernel.org -- which normally hosts all the files -- was compromised, and that everyone involved is being extra-cautious, falls on stone-deaf ears. Going back a bit further, Novell was simultaneously lauded for spending tens of millions defending Linux against SCO, and demonized for making a "deal with the devil" with Microsoft that saw Linux desktops and servers get into thousands of businesses on Microsoft's dime. A Final Lesson ... There has been a long history of such attacks on anyone who "dares" to make a profit, even indirectly, with open source code that is licensed under the GPL. It's no coincidence that alternatives to large chunks of GPL code are under active development. At some point, putting up with the random noise of the self-appointed GNUstapo just isn't worth the hassle and the bad publicity. Apple showed that switching to another base operating system can be done. It did it not once, but twice. Other companies might decide to take the same route rather than continue to deal with a community that doesn't "get it" or have a genuine interest in cooperating to help meet people's real needs.

Manure spread very thick zeke123 Posted 2011-11-02 This article is so bad, its a challenge to figure out where to start. We get it, you dont like the FSF and their message. In the grand scheme of things, it doesnt really matter. Intellectual dishonesty will follow you in your whole career and life. This manure is world class though: Negative campaigns turn people away. Nobody wants to hear about how "evil" their current software provider is. They want to hear what you can do better. and Recall how Jobs ended the demonization of Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT) within Apple, got his people to focus on doing what Apple does best, Apple MADE their name on the jabs they threw at MS.

Barbie_H Posted 2011-11-03 Here's what I wrote (you even quoted it): "Recall how Jobs ended the demonization of Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT) within Apple" ... notice those two words - "within Apple." As I pointed out, product design and engineering had become too obsessed with Microsoft. Jobs made a patent deal with Microsoft, got Microsoft to invest money in Apple as well as continuing to develop Microsoft products for the platform, and got his designers and engineers to concentrate on on Apples strengths, rather than trying to go head-to-head with Microsoft in their own back yard. The day that the advertising department runs Apple's product, design, and engineering departments, you might have a point, but those days are long gone, along with John Sculley.

For over a decade.) it is obvious you are taking his statements out of context. You don't even have the courage to cite your sources, let alone place them in proper context. I challenge you to support your claims, especially your claim that he advocates "software piracy" as you call it. Show us verifiable sources and the context for his remarks. Until you do, I will consider you a blathering idiot. Reply Just google for it Barbie_H Posted 2011-11-03 The quotes were, as I pointed out in the original article, from the fsfe europe web site. You'll also see others acknowledging them in their responses, where they attempt to justify Stallman's claim that making a pirated copy of software for a friend is somehow "the lesser of two evils", the other one being to just say no to them. If a friend asks you to steal for them, are you really doing them a favor by saying yes? The next time you're at the supermarket and you hear some child throwing a fit because they aren't getting what they want NOW, you might want to think about how they (and everyone within earshot) might have benefited from hearing "No" more often. You might also want to consider the class of friends you have if their ... Read More Reply Nice hack job... WorBlux Posted 2011-11-01 "Stallman doesn't believe that programs should compete on either technical merit or on how much users like them." That's a false judgement which does not follow from the facts. The FSF high priority project list shows that they consider features important. He considers freedom and community to be more important. And Barbara, why didn't you cite the specific speech you pulled your quote from? Are you afraid of people actually going to go look at the context, which I'm willing to bet revolves around boycotts rather than any sort of legal controls. "If you remember the party slogan 'Freedom is Slavery,' you might find this quote eerily similar: 'It's a mistake to equate freedom to 'the freedom of choice.''" So the choice to ...

Also imagine that your child was injured, and needed to go to a hospital immediately to avoid dying and your cell phone had no reception and you did not have your own car nearby, but a short distance away you noticed a car with it's keys on the dash. Now would you steal the car or let your child die? Both are an evil, but clearly letting your child die would be the greater one. " This is your defense of Stallman saying it's okay to pirate? That giving a pirated version of a program to someone is akin to using a car without permission to save a child's life? In the latter case, you could make an argument of necessity, but not the former. Also, you'd be expected to give the car back, along with an ...

By your logic you should have no problem with people squatting in your car or home, because, after all, you still retain full title and ownership. Ditto for free access to hotel and motel rooms, taxis, unsold airplane seats, etc. The real world doesn't work that way. But you're welcome to prove me wrong by squatting in someone's car or home, or trying to fly without paying for a ticket, or going into a store and copying a bunch of movies onto your laptop or taking pics of every page in ...

I can plagiarize without violating copyright, (ghost author for a phd thesis, or putting my name on A tale of two cities) and I can violate copyright without plagiarizing. (printing out your articles verbatim) "You're not free to rip it off, any more than you are free to rip off their identity, on the grounds that "they still have it"."

And I haven't ever heard him /encouraging/ what you refer to as stealing of software. Freedom is something that should be prized, so also should sharing in a community of users. You have freedom too, even if you don't want it. There's no need to be bitter towards the open attitude. Reply Your google-fu might need some work Barbie_H Posted 2011-11-03 The quote I referred to is, as I mentioned in the original article, in plain view on the FSFE web site. A simple google would have found it. Just as it would have found the FSF FUD against linux licensing and android in September. And also Bruce Perens lies about his "new covenant license" being anything but new, dating back to 2008-2009. Zealotry is no replacement for proper research, which is why, after spending years defending him, I look at the harm RMS has done and say "we can do a LOT better than that." BTW - why not go to the home page of fsf.org and look at the four freedoms listed in the graphic - and notice how the GPL, in contrast to the bsd, mit, and apache licenses, violates all 4 of them?
