Watch Now » Apple has changed its guidelines on the pricing of in-app subscriptions in the iTunes App Store, according to a MacRumors report. It no longer requires that in-app subscriptions be priced the same as, or less than, subscriptions outside the app, or that external subscriptions must also be offered as in-app purchases, the report claims. If true, this signals a major about-face for Cupertino, whose restrictive rules on in-app subscriptions alienated many publishers. Some publishers refused to deal with Apple, and publishers in Europe called on the EU to launch an antitrust investigation over the issue. In the United States, some major publishers began working on a digital newsstand for the Android platform. U.S. regulators were reportedly considering an antitrust probe of their own. "Maybe Apple decided it wasn't worth fighting with publishers and they'd sell more hardware if the issue went away," speculated Josh Martin, a senior analyst at Strategy Analytics. It's not certain whether Apple's reversal will succeed in luring recalcitrant publishers onto its iOS platform. "It will be interesting to see if this change is enough to get publishers to sign up," Carl Howe, a research director at the Yankee Group, told MacNewsWorld. "Or maybe this is the last gasp and maybe publishers may decide not to do subscriptions on tablets," Howe added. AAPL's Rules Make Publishers See Red When Apple launched subscriptions on the iTunes App Store in February, it mandated that if a user was able to subscribe to the content through any other channel, the app would have to offer new customers a subscription through Apple's in-app system, the revenues from which Apple takes a sizable cut. Also, the in-app subscription price could not be higher than prices the publisher charges through other channels. This would effectively funnel nearly all new users who discover a publication on an iOS device through Apple's system, costing publishers a portion of that revenue. Those rules were due to be enforced as of June 30. Many in the publishing industry were opposed to these restrictions. European publishers asked the EU to consider launching an antitrust investigation of Apple. Five major U.S. publishers launched a joint venture, Next Issue, to work on a digital newsstand for the Android platform. Some of them, including Time and Hearst, already had a few of their own publications on the iPad. Separately, other large publishers, such as the Financial Times, launched negotiations with Apple over the restrictions. Why Some Publishers Were Mad Apple took a 30 percent cut of all apps sold through the iTunes App Store. That was one of the issues spurring publishers' wrath. Apple's revised guidelines might allow publishers to avoid paying that 30 percent, which Apple charges for processing payments through its billing system, by not requiring that external subscriptions be offered as in-app purchases. This 30 percent charge was "a significant hurdle" to getting publishers to sign up and put their publications on iOS, Michael McGuire, a vice president of research at Gartner, told MacNewsWorld. Indeed it was. The Financial Times has launched a Web-based version of the newspaper instead of a native application, in an end run around Apple's subscription rules. However, the question of who owned the customer data was even more contentious. "This [battle with the publishers] really has to do with who owns the customer," the Yankee Group's Howe pointed out. Many publishers contend that customer data is their life's blood and felt uncomfortable about Apple owning that data through its billing system. It's Only Business So why did Apple do an about-face? "Maybe Apple realized that recurring revenue over the long haul would be more beneficial than a quick hit," Strategy Analytics' Martin told MacNewsWorld. "I think Apple doesn't want price to get in the way," the Yankee Group's Howe said. "I believe Apple now thinks it has built a convenient enough process for subscriptions and doesn't have to worry about people wandering off to some other website to sign up for an app," Howe elaborated. Apple did not respond to requests for comment by press time. Get Permission to License or Reproduce this Article Print Email Reprints More by Richard Adhikari Reader Comments Be the first to comment!
