The company announced the news today via Twitter, adding that the virus is “impacting the Virtuos team working on the port,” and that they’d like to give them enough time to properly finish development. The physical version will now be released via cartridge, too, following complaints over the boxed Switch product containing only a download code. The coronavirus continues to have unexpected consequences on the game industry. Earlier today, Nintendo told customers in Japan that production and shipments would be delayed due to supplies produced in China. That includes the highly anticipated Animal Crossing-themed console. Obsidian’s first-person RPG was originally expected to launch on Switch March 6th.
