Watch Now » Slices Pro for Twitter, a mobile app from OneLouder, is available for US$4.99 (no ads) at Google Play. We're seeing an entire genre of Twitter clients proliferating within the Android ecosystem -- each app with its own idea about the best way to interact with the monolithic, 500 million-strong social network. OneLouder's Slices Pro for Twitter is the latest client to grab my attention -- not least because it provides a way to browse Twitter directories by category to find the best Follows. Does this mean it could possibly sift out some chaff? In addition, Slices Pro promises live streams of daily top events and In addition, Slices Pro promises live streams of daily top events and identifies trending tweets by city. I like live, so this is interesting stuff. After my highly successful adoption of the Android app Falcon Pro, which I recently reviewed, I was keen to see if Slices Pro could beat Falcon Pro and its super-slick live-streaming tweets. Why 'Slices' The term "Slices" derives from the unique way this app groups a timeline into categories -- such as News, Local and Politics -- to let you view only what you want to see. Default categories are provided, but you can also create your own -- a good thing, since I found the supplied default categories didn't work. For example, the app correctly decided that NBC News was a News slice, and that Los Angeles Times was a News slice and also a Local slice. However, it miscategorized another Local, deciding that LA Times Live was a News slice only. There were multiple examples of this kind of slice miscategorization in my feed. I found things functioned better when I created my own slice categories, because I got to choose what to place in each slice. You can edit the existing slices too -- time consuming, but ultimately effective. My verdict on Slices is that despite the problems I encountered, it's brilliant. It does what it says it does, in that it allows you to follow only the tweets relevant to you at a particular time -- editing for Twitter feeds. In the past, I've found it necessary to un-follow certain gabby people during newsy times in order to focus. I can see Slices letting me tune them out -- and back in again during quieter moments for their sometimes amusing banter. Easy Exploring The second major differentiator in Slices Pro for Twitter is its Explore functionality. Slices Pro has built directories of dynamic content, like Live Events, Humor, Sports and so on. It's reminiscent of the days of hard-coded Web search before the engine. Web search in the old days, like that supplied by Yahoo, used to consist of pages and pages of HTML -- static links with associated descriptions based on nested categories. Slices Pro Explore is a dynamic version of that. Follows and Sync I have always found Follows based on username guesswork, @ search, or close study of tweet contributors based on a hash-tagged topic. It's nice to see an alternative. A mobile to desktop sync, in beta, is also in the feature-set. It uses forms of TweetCaster, another OneLouder Twitter product. I've used TweetCaster for Android before, and didn't like the childish cutesy, cartoon-drawn tweeting birds look, so I'll pass on Beta testing sync for now. I don't want cute birds forced down my throat unless they're cooked. In Conclusion Slices Pro doesn't live-stream like Falcon Pro does. You still have to refresh the screen to see the latest tweets. However, I'm going to argue that it doesn't really matter, because Falcon Pro and Slices Pro are two very different Twitter clients. Falcon Pro is an excellent set-it-and-forget-it product, and Slices Pro is a superb in-depth interactive discovery tool. Want to Suggest an Android App for Review?
