Last month, we mentioned a mysterious "$1 million laptop about which precious little was known. That's still the case, but a few more tantalizing (and still unconfirmed) details are slowly emerging. Luxurylaunches claims to have the first "official" photo of the laptop from Luvaglio, the namesake company of entrepreneur Rohan Sinclair Luvaglio, and describes it thusly: "The laptop combines intelligent gadgetry with state of the art technology, such as solid-state storage, Blu-ray, built-in USB memory stick and MP3 player, integrated screen cleaning and functional jewelry. The laptop will be finished to the owner's choice of precious metals, leathers and real woods." The handmade computer, which is scheduled for release this summer, is supposedly fully upgradeable. That's good news, because we wouldn't want to shell out another million just for more memory.
