There are rumors that Apple might be planning to beef up its iPhone/iPod touch App Store with a premium games section, and that might deepen the quandary mobile software developers already find themselves in. After all, thousands of applications are already competing for consumer attention, and more are flooding the marketplace every week. How can a product attract notice? "With 15,000 apps available, it's easy for developers -- especially individuals and smaller companies -- to get lost in the crowd," Charles King, principal analyst with Pund-IT, told MacNewsWorld. "In addition, there have been more than a few complaints about the App Store's opaque -- occasionally schizoid -- approval process." Thanks to the Internet, though, there is a growing number of channels for promoting iPhone apps beyond the App Store, King said. One mode is by leveraging YouTube, which, King says, follows the standard "viral" marketing model. "Create a catchy, clever demo video and hope that it creates a buzz -- attracts a crowd," King said. "On the plus side, it's cheap and easy." On the downside, he allowed, being clever and catchy is more difficult than it might appear at first glance. Marketing Outlets Online There are other outlets, such as Longest.com, which provides lists of iPhone advertising networks and ideas on monetizing iPhone applications. AppBeacon.com is another pathway consumers can access to find new iPhone and iPod touch applications. It allows users to post reviews of apps, find new products, and get regular updates on prices and features. Users also can keep track of news about apps. "AppBeacon is one I've read about, which offers app views and reviews," King said. "It's not perfect, but it does seem refreshing when compared to the somewhat monotonous, often static App Store experience." Also, traditional advertising still works, King noted. "If a developer is serious and has the funding, buying online -- or even print -- ads is a viable way to reach customers," he said. "but I think it requires some serious forethought and research to determine whether you'll actually engage your target audience through those vehicles." Specialized advertising services such as AdMob, which focuses exclusively on mobile app branding and marketing, offer another outlet, King said. "I'm not sure about their value -- especially considering the diversity and dispersed nature of the audience for mobile apps -- but they may be worth considering," he said. There really isn't any hard data -- yet -- that points to one mode being more effective than another, said Rob Enderle, principal with the Enderle Group. "I am not sure anyone has done in-depth analysis," he told MacNewsWorld. "It looks like the trick is to get into the top 10, and you likely can buy into that list and get visibility." It certainly doesn't hurt to have a compelling application, he quipped. Getting noticed is the key to success for all software vendors, which puts a premium on marketing strategy, said Jack Gold, principal with J. Gold Associates. "Athough there is one central location, the App Store, it is hard to stand out in a crowd when 15,000 apps are vying for consumer attention," he told MacNewsWorld. Developers have to worker harder than ever to make sales. Getting Conversations Started "They have to promote their wares just like any other vendor does, and hope that the app catches on," Gold said. The marketing program has to get people talking about the application, or it will be lost in a packed marketplace, he warned. "Once there is sufficient 'buzz,' they can expect consumers to find the app in the store," Gold said. "But until then, if they are not out there promoting, they are likely to face very limited sales. Just getting into the App Store does not guarantee success." Things may not get any easier for developers, King said, in light of the fact that Apple recently announced it was pulling out of the annual Macworld Conference & Expo as part of its plan to scale back its involvement in trade shows. "With Apple abandoning Macworld -- and thus placing the conference itself into jeopardy -- the company's power over the developers is likely to become increasingly consolidated or even monolithic," King said. That's not necessarily a bad move, he added. "Companies including Microsoft have demonstrated how nurturing and leveraging the developer community can add to a platform's value," explained King, "but Apple's relationships with developers have been, to put it kindly, somewhat stormy. Depending on how those relationships continue to evolve, alternative developer channels may become increasingly, crucially important."
