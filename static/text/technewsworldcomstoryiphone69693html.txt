Absolutely. Hear experts from Forrester Research and Zurn Industries explain how the value of PIM goes beyond operational efficiencies and share why product content is critical for delivering a great customer experience. Watch the webinar. Apple announced Monday that it had sold over 300,000 iPads over Easter weekend. That was fewer than analysts had forecast, but many still raised their estimates for Apple nonetheless. Analysts expect the iPad to remain a major player in the tablet PC category, although several challengers will hit the market later in the year. Whether their optimism is warranted remains to be seen, as some early buyers have already begun complaining about the iPad. Apple's iPad Figures Cupertino said it sold more than 300,000 iPads on Saturday, including deliveries of pre-ordered units, deliveries to channel partners, and sales at Apple's retail stores. The actual sales figures might be lower than reported -- channel partners might still have product in stock, and Best Buy stores carrying the iPad are reported to have ample supplies. "You have this installed base of Apple fans and that probably made up a good portion of the early buyers," Chris Hazelton, a research director at the 451 Group, told MacNewsWorld. "It would be interesting to know what percentage of the sales came from preorders and what percentage from in-store purchases." Apple also said iPad users downloaded more than one million apps from the iTunes App Store and more than 250,000 e-books from the iBookstore on Saturday. There are more than 3,100 iPad apps in the iTunes store, Mobclix spokesperson Colleen Wickwire told MacNewsWorld. Paid apps make up more than 2,500 of these and free apps about 600. The iPad sales figures sent Apple's share prices up US$1.62 at press time to a new record of $237.59. Analysts Go All Googly-Eyed Before iPad sales began Saturday, analysts had forecast anywhere from 400,000 to 700,000 being snapped up. Although the actual sales figures proved much lower, they weren't disappointed. "Remember the 300,000-plus sold were moved on Saturday only," Brian Marshall, an analyst at Broadpoint AmTech, pointed out. "I'd predicted they'd move 525,000 on Saturday and Sunday, and they actually sold 60 percent of that figure, although some Apple and Best Buy stores were shut for Easter." Had it been a normal weekend, Marshall figures Apple would have sold more than another 200,000 iPads. Marshall is confident demand for the iPad will remain strong. "I still think my forecast of 850,000 sold in the June quarter is conservative, as is my estimate of 4 million sold in calendar year 2010," he told MacNewsWorld. He's not alone; other analysts, including Kaufman Brothers' Shaw Wu, J.P. Morgan's Mark Moskowitz and Piper Jaffray's Gene Munster feel that the iPad will further boost Apple's fortunes; all have raised their price targets for Apple stock. Apple did not respond to requests for comment by press time. The Charge of the iPad Brigade The iPad will push sales of the tablet PC category past 5 million units in 2010, according to DisplaySearch. These devices will take some market share from netbooks and e-book readers, it predicts. Most of them will sell in the United States and Western European markets. "The iPad will lead the market because it's the first out and will set the expectations for other slate products coming to the market," Chris Connery, vice president of market research for PC and IT products at DisplaySearch, told MacNewsWorld. The battle for market share will be intense. "Certainly, slate products from HP and other vendors will be positioned as offering pure access to the Internet through Flash and other features that the iPad doesn't have," Connery pointed out, "but we still expect the iPad to be strong." Apple's Possible Blight Some management decisions, and the success of Apple's marketing machine, may cost the iPad its strong position. Apple's ruling out of Flash on the iPhone and iPad is a decision some analysts fear may cost the iPad sales in the long run. That's because one of the key use cases of the iPad, as marketed by Cupertino, is Web browsing and consumption of online content, Francis Sideco, a principal analyst at iSuppli, pointed out. The lack of Flash support will prevent iPad owners from enjoying Flash-driven content, which is plentiful on the Internet, as well as Web-based games and videos, Sideco said. That could lead to a disappointing browser experience, and Apple's description of the iPad as a "magical and revolutionary product" might come back to haunt Cupertino, Sideco suggested. Perhaps the haunting has already begun. Some early owners are posting complaints on the iPad forum. These include weak WiFi reception, problems with iPad's email app, problems with downloading ebooks, and the inability to sync some imported movies. Future iPad sales may be hampered by the way Apple has positioned the device. "Apple has engineered the iPad to sit perfectly between the iPhone and the MacBook, which could be a drawback," the 451 Group's Hazelton pointed out. "It will be very hard for someone to buy an iPad in place of either Apple product."
