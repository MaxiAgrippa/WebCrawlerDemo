Mike Yamamoto May 7, 2007 7:25 AM PDT The 'eNovo iPhone Clip' EB Well, it's about time. It's been nearly five months since Emperor Jobs anointed the iPhone, and only now are we seeing its first cases. After all, it took only about 5 minutes for a Bluetooth headset to come out. Such is the perverse order of events in the world of high tech, where accessories can often precede the star attraction. But we digress. EBcases has released two new lines, the eNovo iPhone Clip and the eCopilot, according to Textually.org and iPhoneFreak. The Copilot is offered only in "Rouge," but the eNovo case comes in a variety of colors and also fits the Samsung BlackJack and the Motorola Q . EB And even though the iPhone has yet to hit the market, both cases have already been "discounted" to $27 and $40 respectively. How fitting.
