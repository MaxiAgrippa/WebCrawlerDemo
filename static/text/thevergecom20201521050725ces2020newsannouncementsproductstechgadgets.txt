The overall theme was concepts, our staff determined when deliberating the annual Verge Awards at CES 2020, which meant a lot of show without a lot of substance: This year, the things that stole attention at the show were not early looks at products that you and I will be able to actually use and buy over the next 12 months. Sure, there’s the occasional laptop and meat substitute that will be available for purchase in 2020. But for every one of those, there’s a rolling ball robot, virtual personal attendant, or entire vehicle that is never likely to ship. Our Best in Show award went to Lenovo’s Thinkpad X1 Fold, which — even though it’s on the expensive side and left us with a few questions — was the only foldable laptop with a confirmed shipping window and price tag. Most of the other laptops at this year’s CES were pretty boring, however, with little more than incremental updates on display. But there may be hope for the future with 5G modems and new screen technologies on the horizon. We doled out awards for the most triumphant CES comeback (Lora DiCarlo), the most overhyped thing at this year’s show (Samsung’s Neon digital avatars), and the most concept (Sony’s Vision-S) as well. Of course, the best non-CES news that everyone at the show was talking about was Sonos’ lawsuit against Google, in which, it accuses the tech giant of patent infringement. You can find the full list of the best of CES 2020 here. 176 Total Updates Since Dec 19, 2019, 2:56am EST Follow this stream January 30 Ring adds privacy dashboard to app in response to security concerns By Dan Seifert@dcseifert One place to manage security and privacy features 7 comments / new January 16 This startup wants to put a tiny display on a contact lens By Jacob Kastrenakes and Ashley Carman Mojo Vision promises a 14,000 ppi display on your eye 18 comments / new January 14 Insta360’s One R shape-shifts between a 360 and an action camera By Becca Farsace It’s got 360 when you want it, 4K when you don’t January 13 OnePlus confirms its next phone will jump to a 120Hz screen By Dieter Bohn@backlon The new spec war isn’t the number of pixels, it’s how fast they flash 30 comments / new January 13 Asus’ ROG Chakram mouse has an analog stick and wireless charging By Sam Byford@345triangle Plus a whole lot of customization 7 comments / new January 10 How gaming PCs are competing with the PS5 and Xbox Series X By Nick Statt@nickstatt CES 2020 saw smaller, more modular and console-inspired PC gaming hardware 30 comments / new January 10 This year’s monitors will be faster, brighter, and curvier than ever By Sam Byford@345triangle I looked at a lot of screens to find out 24 comments / new January 10 Laptops were boring at CES, but there’s hope for the future By Chaim Gartenberg@cgartenberg Bigger innovations are coming soon 21 comments / new January 10 The most important TVs of CES 2020 were finally for the masses By Jon Porter@JonPorty Trickle down 16 comments / new January 10 The Verge Awards at CES 2020: welcome to the land of the concept By Verge Staff What is even real anymore? 16 comments / new January 10 The rules only sex tech companies have to follow at CES By Ashley Carman@ashleyrcarman No dolls, robots, or anatomically correct devices 21 comments / new January 10 Fewer propellers mean more battery-life for the Falcon bicopter drone By James Vincent Are two propellers better than four? 20 comments / new January 9 This folding 8K drone could rival DJI and Skydio By Vjeran Pavic The consumer drone market could get interesting again 14 comments / new January 9 Roomba’s robot vacuum could grow arms in the near future By Andrew J.
