Handset has touch screen instead Mike Yamamoto December 15, 2006 3:57 PM PST As the mobile phone continues to evolve, traditional keys may eventually become the handset equivalent of prehensile toes. That, at least, appears to be the case with LG's latest designs. According to Slashphone, the "LG KE850" has no keypad and instead relies solely on a touch screen to control its functions. Little else is known about the phone, other than it apparently won an award from the International Forum Design in Germany (which is probably why photos of it are being circulated today). The handset does bear some resemblances to its famous cousin the Chocolate, though there's obviously no slide. But if the design means more real estate for the screen, we're all for it.
