The handset, which Gizmodo reports is made of gold and African Blackwood, is a reminder that the Russians never lost their historical sense of czarist luxury. Little is known about the mobile phone's manufacturer (Gresso), its price or its functionality, other than claims that it is "well equipped technically," according to Gizmodo, and that no two handsets are exactly the same. But with a phone this gorgeous, we frankly don't care. And apparently others feel the same way: For a product with so few public details, it's already generated a good deal of buzz--and even has a YouTube video in circulation (see below).
