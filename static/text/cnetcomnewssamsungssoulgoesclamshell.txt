Reuben Lee March 4, 2008 11:28 AM PST Crave Asia The Korean mobile phone maker has just announced a clamshell version of the Soul handset at the CeBIT tradeshow in Hannover, Germany. Named the G400, the handset's most interesting feature lies in its dual 2.2-inch QVGA LCD displays. That's right, it comes with a 2.2-inch internal screen as well as a 2.2-inch external touchscreen panel. The G400 will also offer a customizable interface, much like the Soul. As with most of Samsung's recent high-end imaging handsets, the HSDPA-enabled G400 comes with a host of strong camera features including a 5-megapixel sensor (with autofocus), face detection, and image stabilizer. Also noteworthy on this dual-screen clamshell are Bluetooth connectivity, microSD card slot, onboard multimedia player and FM radio, and haptic vibration feedback for the touch screen. The G400 is expected to make its way to Asia by summer. More information on that here.
