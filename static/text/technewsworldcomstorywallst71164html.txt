Watch Now » It looks as if Apple is continuing to maintain its lead over rivals in the mobile space. While several vendors have announced new Android tablets or plan to do so next year, and Google Chrome tablets are reported to be coming to retailers' shelves in time for holiday sales, they may not pose much of a threat to the iPad's dominance in the tablet PC market for various reasons. Further, Apple's now the world's fourth-largest smartphone maker, according to IDC's statistics. Sales of the iPhone and iPad remain strong, and demand in the crucial China market is high. Android smartphone sales are growing more rapidly than those of the iPhone, but the Apple device is still ahead by the proverbial nose. It's important to remember that no one Android device dominates, and that statistics for Android smartphones encompass all variations of the operating system and multiple vendors. Building the iDevice Village Apple reportedly released the golden master for iOS 4.2 to developers Monday. The golden master of an operating system is the version that's released to manufacturing, which may indicate that Cupertino may unveil iOS 4.2 by this month, as scheduled. The OS will run on iPhones, iPads and iPods. Apple did not respond to requests for comment by press time. The latest release of the OS will include new features, such as AirPlay wireless streaming of audio, video and photos to Apple TV and other AirPlay-compliant devices. It will bring multitasking to the iPad, together with other features available on the iPhone and iPod touch, such as a unified inbox, support for multiple email alerts, and the ability to open attachments in third-party apps. This means iDevice users will have the same features and capabilities on all their mobile devices. That may well put the iPad even further ahead of the competition because consumers will be able to run the same apps as they move from device to device. This capability is the holy grail of the home entertainment world. "When you think about it, the platform that's going to win will be the one that runs on the most devices, because every consumer wants a unified experience on the most devices," Dmitriy Molchanov, an analyst at the Yankee Group, told MacNewsWorld. That could set the iPad well ahead of the Chrome and Android tablets expected to hit the market later this month. Jagged Little Pills Several notebooks running Google's Chrome OS will arrive on U.S. retail shelves this month, according to the DigiTimes blog. The players may include HP, Acer and Google itself. Meanwhile, ViewSonic has announced two more Android tablets, one of which dual boots on Windows 7. However, none of these is likely to threaten the iPad's position, for various reasons. "To a large extent, the experience on the tablet is governed by the software, and the proliferation of Android tablets means manufacturers will compete on price rather than the customer experience," the Yankee Group's Molchanov pointed out. "If you do that, customers will prefer another device such as a netbook." Further, Google is fragmenting its own market by offering two mobile operating systems, Chrome and Android. Although Google recently said tablet manufacturers should opt for Chrome rather than Android, its suggestion may have fallen on deaf ears. This is possibly because smartphone features are increasingly dominating the mobile market. It's the last factor that makes Apple's iOS 4.2 such a potent threat. Smartphones have the most advanced features of any mobile device, and consumers increasingly demand the convenience and ease of use these devices bring. "I don't think Google's pushing the Chrome operating system is at this point the best strategy, because it should really be aiming at winning the smartphone race," the Yankee group's Molchanov remarked. "That will drive wins in other mobile devices." It's a Numbers Game IDC's Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker showed that Apple ranks fourth of the world's top five mobile phone vendors in the third quarter. Shipments of iPhones accounted for 4.1 percent of the market. [*Correction - Nov. 3, 2010] Nokia was first, with 32.4 percent of the market, Samsung second with 21 percent, and LG Electronics third with 8.3 percent. It's worth noting that the three firms ahead of Apple sell a variety of handsets, from smartphones to low-priced feature phones. All the phones Apple sells are smartphones. While Apple comes up fourth in terms of actual vendors, comparing the sales performance of iPhones with sales of Android phones is comparing one to many. Several vendors offer Android smartphones, and there are various versions of Android on these devices. "Android has been growing, thanks to Samsung, Motorola and HTC," Ramon Llamas, a senior research analyst at IDC, told MacNewsWorld. "It helps Android's cause to have multiple vendors shipping units." Although the iPhone leaves any one Android smartphone far in its wake on a one-to-one comparison of sales, Android could represent a potent threat to the iPhone in the long run. "Fragmentation has been a problem for Android, but it's been limited mostly to gaming applications," Llamas pointed out. "For all other applications, such as news and infotainment, having so many developers has helped because these are fairly standard, so you get the best-of-breed apps." Still Bullish After All These Years Barclays Capital analyst Ben A. Reitzes contends that Apple shares will continue to gain value. Strong iPad demand, a continued ramp-up of iPhone supply, significant international expansion and new innovations in the pipeline make Apple's valuation very attractive, he wrote in a note to investors this week. Sales for the iPhone should remain strong into the fourth quarter, with holiday sales momentum and strong demand in China. Apple's online retail store in China, which launched last week, ran out of iPhone 4s, Reitzes said. Apple stocks closed at US$309.36 in an up market Tuesday, a gain of $5.18, possibly signaling a recovery from the slide they hit following the $318 record they reached Oct. 18. *ECT News Network editor's note - Nov. 3, 2010: The original publication of this article reported that Apple had 14.1 percent of the global mobile phone market in the third quarter, according to IDC. In fact, Apple had 4.1 percent. Get Permission to License or Reproduce this Article Print Email Reprints More by Richard Adhikari Reader Comments Be the first to comment!

The damage to the global economy would be incalculable. Many people would not be able to communicate with loved ones and friends. It would make working from home impossible.
