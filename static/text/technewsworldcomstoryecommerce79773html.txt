Watch Now » Up to now, the malware program CryptoLocker has been king of the ransomware roost, but PowerLocker (formerly PrisonLocker) may present a new challenge. "It has some interesting countermeasures to thwart researchers," Harry Sverdlove, CTO of Bit9, told TechNewsWorld. Among those countermeasures are the ability to determine if it's running on a virtual machine -- and if so, to alter its behavior. Researchers will run questionable programs on virtual systems to avoid infecting a networked box. "We don't know what that behavior would be, but presumably it would be to act benign," Sverdlove said. PowerLocker also has sandbox detection. Software sandboxes are used to isolate an app's behavior and prevent it from spreading any nastiness it may contain. Bitcoin Connection One way to thwart ransomware is to maintain a good backup regimen, so if one data set gets involuntarily encrypted, a backup set can be used to restore it. PowerLocker's authors appear to have thought of that angle, too. "It can scan removable devices, looking for potential backups or other tertiary files so it can encrypt those as well," Sverdlove said. "The authors have taken some of the lessons learned from CryptoLocker and improved upon it," he added. "It's the next-generation CryptoLocker." Ransomware has been around for sometime, but its recent rise in popularity may be linked to better means for collecting unjust rewards. "What makes ransomware more popular now is the anonymity by which you can make and receive payments," Sverdlove said. One of those ways is through the digital currency Bitcoin, which "allows people to get money anonymously," said Greg Foss, a senior security research engineer with LogRhythm. "That's part of why the CryptoLocker campaign has been so successful," he told TechNewsWorld. Yahoo Serves Up Malads Poisoning advertising on Web pages is a common tactic used by online miscreants to spread malware. The practice was scaled up bit last week when a Yahoo server began distributing infected ads (see Breach Diary below). "The methodology used in the recent Yahoo attack is not new," Oscar Marquez, chief product officer at Total Defense, told TechNewsWorld. "The difference here is simply the scope of the infection." The technique used to infect the Yahoo ads is called "cross-site scripting." In this case, a Web page element called an "iframe," which is invisible to users, was used to direct them to a malicious website. "There was no user interaction needed for the exploit to be downloaded. Simply visiting a page with an infected ad could have resulted in infection," Marquez explained. "The criminal enterprises behind today's malware want to infect as many systems as possible," he added. "The more systems they can infect, the greater their profit will be. So I believe that they will use this iframe attack type again in the future, because it has proven to work." College Purchasing Scams Boston College began notifying its suppliers last week to be on the alert for university purchasing poseurs. BC warned of a national fraud scam targeting college suppliers in an email message sent to suppliers by Assistant Director of Procurement Services Jerri Cole. "According to multiple schools, the emails request quotes for specific merchandise," explained the message, which was obtained by TechNewsWorld. "Later, a purchase order is emailed to the business that bears resemblance to an authentic University purchase order. The purchase order instructs delivery to an address not affiliated with the University," it continued. "After shipping the merchandise, the business never receives payment and is unable to retrieve the mailed products," the message said. Nearby Wellesley College posted a similar warning on the home page for its purchasing department. "It has been brought to our attention that there is an active email scam involving purchase orders and requests for product quotations that seem to originate from Wellesley College but are in fact fraudulent," the warning declares. "We are actively working with ... law enforcement to investigate these fraudulent emails." Jenny Shearer, a spokesperson for the FBI's national office, told TechNewsWorld the agency was unfamilar with the scam. Data Breach Diary Jan. 5.
