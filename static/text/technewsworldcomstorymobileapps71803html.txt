Watch Now » Tap DJ, an app from Laan Labs, is available for US$1.99 at the App Store. Making, mixing, mashing and mutating music with the help of digital workstation software can be a painstaking process. Hours can be spent touching up a few seconds of audio until it's just right, and much work can be put into perfecting layers of sound so subtle that only listeners with a $400 set of headphones are ever going to hear it. Mixing with a nice set of turntables transforms the process into more of a performance art. The basic technical elements are still there, but the task is done in the moment in front of an audience with a low tolerance for mangled beats. In the world of iPhone software, something like NanoStudio (reviewed herehere) is an example of the former, while Tap DJ presents you with two turntables and challenges you to come up with something listenable using the songs you already have stored in the device. I Got Two Turntables and an iPhone When you open Tap DJ for the first time, you'll see the main interface: two turntables, seven sliders and various buttons. You'll be offered a quick tutorial that shows you what each control does. You'll first want to load some tracks. You can select any of the songs currently in your iPhone as long as they aren't tainted by the DRM iTunes used to tie its songs up with. You also get a Samples Case with a few preinstalled 15-second samples and drum loops, as well as recordings you've made yourself using the device. Once your songs are ready, their cover art will appear in each record's center label -- nice touch. The sliders above the record will quickly take you to any point in the song, and spinning the record with your fingers doesn't just give you the obligatory wicky-wicky -- it actually simulates the sound that record would make while moving under the needle at that speed. And you don't even have to scratch up your vinyl. There are two independent play/pause buttons beneath the turntables, as well as a cross-fader and independent volume controls. Speed sliders let you slow down or speed up each track anywhere from a near-stop to 1.5 times the normal rate. The main control button at the bottom center takes you to further options. An Effect section allows for echo, reverb and gyro effects that let you do some scratching by shaking the phone around, provided you have an iPhone 4. Each effect set is assigned to an individual track. A simple three-channel EQ is also present, and you can assign up to three cue points for each track, which can be looped or played as on-demand one-off riffs. Back to the main screen, the grid button on the left gives you fast access to nine samples, while the arrow on the right gives you the chance to share a mix via a TinyURL link, record a mix for exportation to iTunes, make a voice recording, access help, provide feedback, or install additional features. So far, the only available option seems to be a "Doodle" skin. Touchy, Touchy Once you have your tracks in place and all desired effects up and running, it's time to get mixing. Best not just hit Play and see what happens, because that will most assuredly sound like crap. Or go ahead and do it, just to get an idea of what the final product should not sound like. Live mixing is a craft that takes practice. However, your success will depend on what kind of mix you have in mind going in. If your goal is to import a good drum loop and add in your own freestyle scratches and a handful of samples, you will make actual music after small amount of self-training. But if you have more complicated projects in mind -- perhaps an honest-to-God, head-to-head mashup between two songs you've just got to hear together -- then Tap DJ may not be the right tool for the job. Matching tempo is a vital element to a mashup, and the controls on Tap DJ suffer from a common case of touchscreen slider syndrome. That is, it's really hard to make small adjustments on a touchscreen slider because the act of taking your finger away from the screen sometimes registers as a further adjustment. The app allows you to do more precise tweaks by tapping to the left or right of the slider, but it's just not the same as having an actual control at your fingertips. In fact, anyone with sausage fingers like mine might have a hard time with the controls in general. I'd frequently touch the speed slider when trying hit the volume and hit a menu key when trying to hit the speed slider. Finally, the app's ability to use pretty much your entire music collection (except for those old DRMed files) puts an extraordinary selection of sounds at your fingertips. But its music library can only be browsed by straight-ahead scrolling. There's no sidebar for quickly getting to any point in the alphabet, and if you're looking for one song among thousands and it starts with a "W," you may be stuck scrolling for a while. In fact, the app's insistence on displaying album art next to each entry's title seems to slow down the scrolling process, and I think it even made the app crash once or twice. Bottom Line Tap DJ is a fun as long as you keep it simple. Get a drum'n'bass track going, mix up some samples, and maybe throw in a few well-placed scratches for good measure. But the app's controls are small and rely on a touchscreen. Of course, there's really no other way to do it if you're writing an app for iPhone. But it can bring about frustration if you use Tap DJ for a more complicated project.
