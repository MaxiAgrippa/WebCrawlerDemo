Sure, why not. It would go well with your million-dollar cell phone. After all, it's not often you see a storage device that looks like a gold bar embedded with Statsuma Kiriko crystals (as if we've ever heard of them). Akihabara News reports that the 2GB "Mottainai" is made by SolidAlliance, which it says is "an expert for uncommon USB keys." Apparently so, though we might offer a different adjective, given that the Mottainai's case is bronze. At that price, you'd think it would be solid gold. Once you've come to your senses and want to confess the sins of your egregious excess, you can always switch to one of these.
