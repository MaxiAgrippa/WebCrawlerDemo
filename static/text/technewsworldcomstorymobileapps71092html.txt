PhotoCopier, an app from Digital Film Tools, is available for US$1.99 at the App Store. PhotoCopier (click image to enlarge) Have you ever wondered what a photo you've taken would look like if it were painted by a master like Monet? How about if it were taken by a maestro of photography like Margaret Bourke-White? Or maybe you'd like to try your hand at transforming an image with photo processing. Those are the kinds of things you can do to your digital snapshots with an iPad app called "PhotoCopier." Images are brought into the software through the iPad's native photo album app. For bulk loading of pics from my desktop into the app, I found the free Dropbox app to be a handy tool. Dropbox is an online storage site. It will give you two gigabytes of disk space in the "cloud" for free. Once you have an account, it's simple to move images from a computer to Dropbox to the iPad, as well as move photos in the opposite direction. Non-Destructive Editing After bringing a snapshot into PhotoCopier, you can choose how you want the image emulated--as a painting from a famous artist or a photo from a notable lensslingers -- or apply a classic processing technique to it. When emulating a painting, you can choose from a list of 72 artists, such as Bellini, Bosch, Chagall, Dali, Klee, Picasso, Rembrandt, Renoir, Van Gough and Vermeer. Each artist is linked to one of their paintings. The emulation is designed to reflect the master's style in that particular painting. So if you wanted your photo to emulate a Monet, you'd have to choose from his style in "Alley in the Garden in Giverny," "Haystack at the End of Summer" or "Rouen Cathedral." After applying an emulation, you can tweak it with a number of slider controls. They let you change the brightness, color and tone of the picture. You can modify the grain, detail and texture of it, too. What's more, you can vignette the photo and control how much of the image is obscured by the effect, as well as its size and softness. You can flip between a full screen view of your original photo and its modified doppelganger by tapping a "lightning bolt" control on a toolbar at the top of the screen. This feature might be more useful, though, if both photos could be displayed side by side. Fun to Play With If you change your mind about one or a series of modifications to a photo, the program's multiple levels of undo permits you to scrap the changes with a few finger pokes. When you're finished with a photo, you can save it to the iPad without worrying about the original being altered in any way. If you'd like to apply the style of a great photographer to one of your images, PhotoCopier gives you 40 to choose from. They include Abbot, Andreev, Cunningham, Fenton, Nadar, Outerbridge, Stieglitz and Weston. As with the painters, the software uses the photog's style in a particular photo. Most of the styles are for black and white pictures. When modifying a monotone image, tools for making changes in color pictures are removed from the slider panel. Some of the neatest effects of the software can found in processes mode. Some processes you may be familiar with -- Polaroid processing and Infrared, for example -- and other you may not, such as Gum Bichromate and Ambrotype. But the effects are fun to play with and can produce some very interesting results. As with much of the software in this category, the effects can vary greatly. Sometimes you can apply a style and barely notice any change in a photo. Other times, an effect can be fascinating. Overall, though, PhotoCopier performs well and many image snappers will find the app will spur their creativity.
