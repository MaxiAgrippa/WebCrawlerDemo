Cloud Infrastructure CenturyLink unveils service that adds marketing analytics to venue-based Wi-Fi Eric Emin Wood @ericewood Published: July 12th, 2016 Canadians love their free Wi-Fi, and are willing to provide personal data in exchange for incentives – so why not combine the two? Location-Based Analytics, the new software as a service (SaaS) released Tuesday by global communications firm CenturyLink Inc., offers venue owners access to adaptive, marketing-based analytics they can use to learn more about their customers while delivering value – in the form of reliable wireless service – in return. The goal is to provide the owners of large-scale destinations whose visitors typically expect free WiFi – such as amusement parks, college campuses, shopping malls, train stations, and airports – with real-time marketing and social engagement tools they can use to forge deeper emotional connections with their customers, Troy Trenchard, CenturyLink’s vice president of product management, said in a statement. Analytics-wise, venue owners can use the platform to gather demographic, location, and activity data, or combine it with third-party CRM platforms or eCommerce data to produce detailed, personalized customer snapshots, which are then displayed in an online hub that can also be used to monitor customer traffic and location information. The service’s marketing tools can then be used to target customers with real-time messages, offers, review incentives, event-based apps, or activity suggestions. The service’s analytics reporting and marketing tools are based on technology developed by “intelligent spaces” firm Purple, which supports venues across the hospitality, retail, and restaurant industries in 73 countries.
