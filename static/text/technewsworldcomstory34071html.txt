Mac users can either obtain the update through OS X's Software Update preference panel or at Apple's Web site, which provides a complete rundown of the update's enhancements. The update addresses a host of issues, from the ability for iTunes and iSync to recognize an iPod connected by USB 2.0 to improved networking and printing functionalities. While Apple noted that the OS update includes its May 24th security update, released as a response to the recent Uniform Resource Locator security issues, this version does not provide additional protection for continued URI-related issues reported over the past weekend, as MacNewsWorld has recently reported [Blane Warren, "OS X Security Hole Bites Apple" MacNewsWorld, May 24, 2004]. Two Separate Issues Mac Observer editor-in-chief Bryan Chaffin told MacNewsWorld labeled the OS 10.3.4 update and the security update two separate issues. "Rationally, Apple will roll out the security updates as quickly as they are ready," Chaffin said. "I wouldn't want to see the company delay the OS update while waiting for a security update." At the same time, Chaffin said he would like to see Apple be more open about its road map for dealing with these newest flaws. In the meantime, experts have recommended freeware programs to protect themselves from these vulnerabilities, including Unsanity's "Paranoid Android" and Monkey Food's More Internet. Lots of Tiny Things For his part, Mark Anbinder, senior technical consultant at Cornell University, told MacNewsWorld that rolling the recent security updates into 10.3.4 is still a good thing. "Users who think, 'Oh, I don't need a security update,' may be less reticent about an upgrade to a newer OS revision," he said. According to Anbinder, the update offers little in the way of "sexy" functionality. "It contains lots of tiny things, none of which I'm all that excited about." "Fixing the problems with external storage devices -- ranging from FireWire-connected digital-video cameras to SCSI-connected fast hard drives -- is probably the most significant thing worth pointing to," he continued. Unlike some of Apple's past updates, version 10.3.4 has for the most part created few problems for users. "The only difficulty I've heard about is an anecdotal report of trouble using Matterform's Spamfire software following [this] update, but other users are reporting no trouble there," said Anbinder.
