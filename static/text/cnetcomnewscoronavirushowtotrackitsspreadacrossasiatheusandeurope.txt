The deadly coronavirus continues to spread across the globe, and you can use an online dashboard to keep up with all reported cases. The Center for Systems Science and Engineering has built a tool pulling in data from the World Health Organization, as well as the centers for disease control in the US, China and Europe. It shows all confirmed, suspected and recovered coronavirus patients, as well as deaths. Coronavirus, which originated in Wuhan, China, has so far killed 26,996 people and infected over 591,000 as of 4:00 p.m. PT on March 27, according to the dashboard. Around 130,000 people have recovered. The 10 countries with the highest case count are the US with 101,657; Italy with 86,498; mainland China with 81,897; Spain with 64,285; Germany with 50,871; France with 33,402; Iran with 32,332; the UK with 14,743; Switzerland with 12,928; and South Korea with 9,332. The dashboard shows the virus has spread to 176 countries, with even the smallest areas including Faroe Islands and Vatican City reporting cases. Cases have been confirmed in North America, Europe, Asia, the Middle East, Africa, South America, Australia and the Pacific, with the illness exhibiting pneumonia-like symptoms. It was first reported to the World Health Organization on Dec. 31, 2019, with Chinese scientists linking the disease to a family of viruses known as coronaviruses that include the deadly SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).
