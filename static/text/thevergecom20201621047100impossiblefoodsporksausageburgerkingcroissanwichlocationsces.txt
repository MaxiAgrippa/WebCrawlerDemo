Pork is the most eaten meat in the world, making Impossible Pork a notable addition to Impossible’s lineup. Pork made up more than 36 percent of the world’s meat intake in 2012, according to United Nations data. (Cattle and buffaloes made up 22.2 percent of the world’s meat intake, by contrast). Pork is also especially popular in China, making Impossible Pork an important product for the company’s global expansion. Like the Impossible Burger, both Impossible Pork and Impossible Sausage are gluten free, have no animal hormones or antibiotics, and are designed for halal and kosher certification. And Impossible Pork and Impossible Sausage both use soy as their main ingredient, and each contain heme, a genetically engineered yeast that makes the Impossible meat substitutes look and taste like meat, according to Bloomberg. Impossible Pork and Sausage are gluten free and have no animal hormones or antibiotics It’s unclear when or where you’ll be able to buy Impossible Pork in the near future, as Impossible hasn’t yet shared details about when it might be available. You might be able to try out Impossible Sausage sometime soon, though — and in fact, you might already have. Impossible first announced it last May and you could initially buy it as a pizza topping at select Little Caesars restaurants. And if you live in Savannah, Georgia; Lansing, Michigan; Springfield, Illinois; Albuquerque, New Mexico; and Montgomery, Alabama, Impossible says you’ll be able to try the Impossible Sausage starting January 13th at one of 139 Burger King restaurants in those areas on a limited-time Impossible Croissan’wich, which is Burger King’s brand-friendly name for its breakfast sandwich. Impossible Foods’ partnership with Burger King is nothing new, as the two companies have seen great success with the Impossible Whopper, which was first available at 59 US Burger King locations and expanded with a nationwide rollout to more than 7,000 stores just four months later. Impossible isn’t the first to release a plant-based sausage, though, as competitor Beyond Meat has offered Beyond Sausage since 2018, and you can try it right now at Dunkin’ on the Beyond Sausage Sandwich or buy it in grocery stores. (Impossible just started its grocery store rollout back in September with local Gelson’s Markets in Southern California.) Both companies are working to make their meat substitutes available not only at more restaurants around the country, but also in as many different formats as possible. You can now also buy Impossible Burgers at White Castle, for example, and Carl’s Jr. offers a burger based on a Beyond Meat patty.
