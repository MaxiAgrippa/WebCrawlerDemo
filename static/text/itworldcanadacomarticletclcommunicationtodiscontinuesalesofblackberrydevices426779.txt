Infrastructure Mobility TCL Communication to discontinue sales of BlackBerry devices Pragya Sehgal @itworldca Published: February 3rd, 2020 TCL Communication will no longer sell BlackBerry-branded mobile devices starting August 31, 2020. BlackBerry’s brand licensing agreement with TCL Communication is due to end on Aug. 31 and the TCL has no further rights to design, manufacture or sell any new BlackBerry mobile devices. BlackBerry made the announcement this morning on Twitter. However, TCL will be supporting its existing portfolio of Blackberry mobile devices including warranty and customer service until Aug. 22, 2022, or for as long as required by the local laws where the mobile device was purchased. Also: BlackBerry adds Cylance to QNX, announces partnerships with AWS, Damon, and Renovo TCL Communication had entered into a brand licensing and technology support agreement with BlackBerry, in December 2019, to make new BlackBerry mobile devices (smartphones) and tablets available globally. Since then, until today, BlackBerry smartphones were manufactured, marketed and sold by TCL Communication globally – under the brand of Blackberry Mobile. They are manufactured, marketed and sold by Optiemus Infracom in the South African markets; and BB Merah Putih in the Indonesian markets. BlackBerry hasn’t revealed if it plans to start manufacturing its own smartphones globally or look for another manufacturing partner to do it under a similar brand licensing agreement. The product portfolio of TCL Communications includes TCL, BlackBerry and Alcatel branded devices.
