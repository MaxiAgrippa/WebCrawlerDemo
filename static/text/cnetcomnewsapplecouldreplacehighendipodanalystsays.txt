In a research note Tuesday, American Technology Research analyst Shaw Wu said that Apple has told distributors "that its high-end 60 GB vPod is 'at risk' until the end of April, meaning it could be discontinued and/or replaced." It may still be a ways off, however. "Timing is not certain to us, but we believe a new widescreen vPod with Bluetooth headphones could be ready as early as the June quarter," Wu wrote.
