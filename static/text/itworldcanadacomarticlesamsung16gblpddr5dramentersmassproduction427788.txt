The new package feature 30 per cent higher density than its previous generation 12GB modules. Designed for mobile devices, these new RAM packages will be used for future generation smartphones. Each package contains eight 12Gb chips and four 8Gb chips. Samsung first revealed its 6GB LPDDR5 package in June 2019, and then subsequently released a 12GB package a month later. The 12GB package is currently being used in Samsung’s newly released Galaxy S20 series smartphones. Also: Samsung launches Galaxy Z Flip foldable phone and Galaxy S20 series smartphones As an intermediate cache between the storage and the processor, faster RAM could translate to a more responsive smartphone experience, especially when exchanging data in high-demanding apps. Lower power consumption also increases battery life. The DRAM, indicated Samsung, will help 5G- and AI-equipped phones deal with increased amounts of data, helping them run more smoothly. With a data bandwidth at 5,500 Mbps, Samsung’s LPDDR5 is 1.3 times faster than its existing LPDDR4X. In addition, it’s also 20 per cent more energy-efficient than LPDD4X with up to twice the capacity in the same footprint. LPDDR4X already operates at 0.6v, so reducing the power consumption by 20 per cent while increasing density and performance is no small feat. Samsung is also planning on mass-producing its third-gen LDDR5 products later this year, as well as even faster 6,400Mbps memory chipsets.
