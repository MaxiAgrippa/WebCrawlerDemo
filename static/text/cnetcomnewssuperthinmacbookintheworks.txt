Rumors of MacBook Thin Matt Elliott December 13, 2006 3:41 PM PST CNET Networks Could this be the headliner at next month's MacWorld? Or perhaps share the stage with an iPhone or an iTV? The volume is increasing about the rumored return of a 12-inch Apple laptop, the likes of which have not been seen since the now-defunct 12-inch PowerBook. This time around, Apple's version of an ultraportable laptop, which Mac OS Rumors is calling the "MacBook Thin," reportedly will feature a 12-inch wide-screen display and similar specs as current MacBook Pro models, including Core 2 Duo processors, 667MHz DDR2 memory, 120GB (or bigger) hard drive, and ATI Radeon Mobility X1600 or Nvidia GeForce Go 7600 graphics. It'll be thinner than current MacBook Pro models--which aren't exactly chunky at just an inch thick--while still finding room to squeeze in an optical drive, a feature commonly left out of ultraportables. Finally, Mac OS Rumors reports that the battery will run for 6.5 hours and perhaps as long as 8 hours. Via Ars Technica.
