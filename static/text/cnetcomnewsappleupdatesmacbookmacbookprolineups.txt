Also, the MacBook Pro will inherit the Air's multitouch trackpad. Mike Ricciuti February 26, 2008 10:21 AM PST Apple updated its MacBook and MacBook Pro lineups today with Intel's Penryn processors, while bringing multitouch trackpads to MacBook Pros. The MacBook Pro is available with Core 2 Duo (Penryn) processors at up to 2.6GHz and up to 6MB of cache memory. Storage options have been revised to include up to a 300GB hard drive. In addition, Apple has added Nvidia's GeForce 8600M GT graphics processor with up to 512MB of video memory. The 17-inch model now gives you the option to upgrade the LCD to an LED-backlit unit for $100. That feature is still standard on the smaller 15-inch model. The MacBook Pro will also now include the multitouch trackpad, first introduced with the MacBook Air. The trackpad lets users rotate photos and browse Web pages using gestures such as pinch, rotate, and swipe. A MacBook Pro with a 15-inch display, 2.4GHz processor, 3MB of L2 cache, and a 200GB hard disk lists for $1,999. The 17-inch model, with a 2.5GHz Core 2 Duo chip, 6MB of L2 cache, and a 250GB hard drive is priced at $2,799, Apple said. The MacBook misses out on the multitouch trackpad, but the prices of the three baseline models stay the same while the configurations get CPU and hard-drive bumps. The $1,299 and $1,499 models now come standard with 2GB of RAM. Previously, doubling the standard 1GB of RAM set you back an additional $150. The $1,099 MacBook includes a 2.1GHz Core 2 Duo (Penryn) processor, 1GB of memory, and a 120GB hard drive (up from 80GB). The $1,299 model gives you a 2.4GHz chip, 2GB of memory, and a 160GB drive (up from 120GB). The $1,499 black model now comes with a 250GB drive (up from 160GB). One thing Apple did not announce Tuesday--at least not yet--is an iPhone software developer kit that it had promised for sometime in February.
