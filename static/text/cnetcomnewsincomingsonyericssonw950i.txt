Crave can't wait for a close-up look at the Nokia N91's nemesis Andrew Lim February 2, 2007 2:57 AM PST You're Marty McFly and the year is 2015. You've just parked your Delorean, put on your self-lacing Nike trainers, donned your self-drying jacket and jumped on to your hoverboard. Life is great... then suddenly you remember you've left your mobile at home, so you jump in the car and fly back to the, er, past. Crave can't begin to tell you how much we wish we were McFly (the wisecracking time traveller, not the spotty boy band). But we think Sony Ericsson might be on their way to creating the mobile phone that would be lying in wait in Marty's bedroom. Presenting the W950i, Sony Ericsson's next-generation Walkman phone. Weighing in at 112g and only 15mm thick, this phone packs an impressive 4GB of internal memory. Not to mention a 262k colour touchscreen with a 240x320-pixel resolution, an FM radio, push email and handwriting recognition. It also has dedicated music player keys and a jog dial for quick access to your MP3 collection. This is undeniably a cool phone. Just look at it. It has a completely flush keypad, it has a huge screen -- and it's purple. Unfortunately, reality bites and the fantasy starts to dwindle. There's no camera or Wi-Fi and if it's going to make it to 2015, it needs them badly. Expect a full review soon. -AL Update: We now have a full review of the Sony Ericsson W950i live in our Reviews channel.
