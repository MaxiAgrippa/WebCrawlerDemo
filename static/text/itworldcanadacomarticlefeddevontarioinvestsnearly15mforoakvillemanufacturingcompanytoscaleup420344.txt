Media Resources, which was founded in 1967 and has offices in Calgary, Edmonton, Vancouver, and Fort Mills, South Carolina, specializes in large format printing, digital LED displays, 3D fabrication and sign installation services to the billboard, advertising, commercial sign, sports and building sectors. The company’s fastest-growing area is its Digital Display Division, which manufactures indoor and outdoor digital LED signage. “As a Canadian manufacturing business with very strong growth in export, the stability, quality and competitiveness of our supply chain is critical to our future,” said Jeff Rushton, Media Resources’ president and chief executive officer, in a press release. “Thanks to FedDev Ontario support for this project, Media Resources is able to construct a state of the art LED module production plant in Oakville to replace production currently outsourced to overseas contract manufacturers. Besides protecting Canadian intellectual property, we will employ new technical staff to operate the production system, support our local fabricators and suppliers, and expect an expansion in our business overall.” Announced today by Oakville MP John Oliver, this investment – which will be accompanied by $2.7 million in funding from the private sector – will help create 16 new jobs, according to the press release.
