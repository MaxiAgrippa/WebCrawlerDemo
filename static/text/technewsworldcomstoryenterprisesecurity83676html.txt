Mello Jr. Jul 8, 2016 10:13 AM PT 2020 online shopping habits and retailer strategies For the fourth year in a row, Episerver has surveyed over 4,000 global online shoppers to learn about their ecommerce expectations and habits. Download Reimagining Commerce now to get an exclusive look at successful retail strategies in 2020. The number of mobile ransomware victims across the globe has increased fourfold compared to a year ago, suggests a Kaspersky Lab report released last week. Kaspersky software protected 136,532 users targeted by ransomware from April 2015 to March 2016 -- up from 35,413 in the year-ago period, the company said. "The growth curve may be less than that seen for PC ransomware, but it is still significant enough to confirm a worrying trend," the report notes. It identifies several factors contributing to the growth of ransomware in general: First, people are willing to pay the ransoms. Second, the value of the information stored on digital devices is so high now that paying a ransom to recover it is more cost-effective than not paying the ransom. Third, law enforcement is having difficulty responding to the problem. Fourth, new payment tools make it easier for extortionists to collect ransoms. Risky Business Collecting money from victims always has been problematic for online criminals, the report notes. Some criminals have tried to use legitimate systems to harvest their money. "The problem for criminals is that legitimate payment systems, reacting to the rise in fraudulent payments, have started to track and block suspicious transactions, making money transfer a far more risky business for cyber-crooks," the report explains. Others have tried to use underground or semi-legal payment systems with equally unsatisfactory results. "With underground and semi-legal payment systems the problem is that no guarantees are given to the users of such systems (no refunds, no protection from other criminals) and the privacy of these transactions is also always questionable," notes the report. However, with the rise of cryptocurrencies, like bitcoin, the payment landscape changed. For the first time, information highwaymen had a dependable way to obtain ill-gotten gains. "Criminals have started to exploit the advantages crypto-currencies over other type of e-currency: anonymity and a distributed nature, which both allow them to hide fraudulent transactions and make it impossible for a law enforcement agency to do anything... ." the report explains. "These features help to support individual privacy rights but, unfortunately also give cybercriminals a very reliable and secret payment tool," it continues. "The main outcome of this is that ransomware has become the new black in the underground." Encryption vs. Locking Screen Although some mobile ransomware strains emulate their personal computer counterparts and encrypt all the data on a phone, that's not the typical MO for wireless extortionists. "With a PC, the ransomware encrypts your files, encrypts your backup and leaves everything as garbage on your machine and then [demands] a ransom payment," explained Ryan Naraine, head of the global research and analysis team at Kaspersky Lab. "On mobile, in some cases they're doing encryption, but in most cases, they're just locking the screen and not allowing you to get into the phone at all," he told TechNewsWorld. "It's the same model. You make the end user completely desperate to get access to his files, and that desperation leads to paying the ransom." However, if a mobile user has a backup of the phone's data or isn't concerned about preserving the data on it, then the ransomware can be defeated by doing a hard reset of the phone. Protect Yourself Following are Naraine's tips for users who want to reduce the risk of being infected with ransomware: Never download apps from anywhere but the Google Play store. Patch Android and applications as soon as upgrades are available. Use common sense when granting permissions to an application. "If you download a flashlight app," Naraine said, "and it's asking for access to your contact list, that should raise a red flag to a user." IRS Ditches PIN Program After shutting down its Electronic Filing PIN program earlier this month, the IRS last week announced that it's readying a more secure solution for next year's tax season. The solution includes expansion of the agency's pilot program to add 16-digit verification codes to W-2 forms. Although the IRS originally had planned to shutter its Electronic Filing PIN program later this year, it decided to act earlier because of stepped-up attacks on the system in recent weeks. The service earlier this year revealed that tax thieves had used stolen Social Security numbers and a program to guess PINs to compromise 100,000 taxpayer logins. Still, the IRS stopped more fraud this year than last -- US$1.1 billion, compared to $350 million. IRS Confidence Shaky The IRS' decision to kill its PIN program ahead of schedule may embolden attackers. "This is an admittance of failure and a step backward for usability," said Rami Essaid, CEO of Distil Networks. "It signals that they are not confident in their security posture and will likely lead the attackers to continue to explore other vulnerabilities," he told TechNewsWorld. The PIN system was flawed from the start, Essaid maintained. "They did not implement an effective bot detection and mitigation service, nor did they instrument their Web application with the proper security logic to identify and track automated brute force and credential cracking attacks." Any efforts by the IRS to create a more secure PIN system will need to recognize the realities of the current threat environment. "Authentication has always been a significant target for attack in IT," explained Tim Erlin, director of IT security and risk strategy at Tripwire. "When an organization offers a service to the public that's protected with some kind of authentication, it's going to be a target," he told TechNewsWorld. "Breaches are a fact of life these days, and every organization needs to have a response plan in place before they are affected." Breach Diary June 26.
