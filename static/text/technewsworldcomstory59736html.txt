The persistent rumors regarding Google's efforts at developing a mobile phone took another surprising turn over the weekend. An article in The New York Times said Google isn't building a "Gphone," but will develop a Linux-based operating system for mobile phones instead. Newspaper of record or not, Mark Specker, head of technology research for Anián, is not about to ditch his Gphone stance. "There still seems to be evidence that Google is considering either marketing a cell phone directly, or is engineering a working cell phone-software unit that a wireless operator could offer, and that is prepared for manufacturing," Specker told LinuxInsider. "I leave it to you to decide if this meets the definition of a Google mobile phone." A Google spokesperson declined to comment Tuesday when asked about the Gphone and Google's software intentions. Linux at the Core The report in The New York Times referred to "industry executives familiar with the project," "people briefed on the project," and "analysts" who said that Google will debut software with applications that go beyond its present-day search and map software. That the core of the Google system will be based on Linux is little surprise, Specker said. Linux, the fast-growing operating system for smartphones, is an inarguably sound starting point. "Processor chips are now fast enough and use little enough power to run the complex kernel, supporting layers of security and networking that come with Linux," Specker said. Developers point to the Linux architecture as ideal for mobile designs, in that it is an open design highly customizable for different environments. Linux only provides the naked operating system. The manufacturer builds the interface, telephone, and application platforms on top of Linux. No Sense All the same, the thought of Google centering all its energies on an operating system alone makes no sense, argued Specker. "If Google were to just create an operating system, but leave all the hard work of making a useful product from it to another company, it is possible nothing would come of it," he said. This is not the first time Anián Research has stood its ground over a whole-nine-yards Gphone. Earlier this year, Anián's Jennifer Tan created waves when she filed a report that said Google was contracting a Taiwan manufacturer, HTC, to design the phone's hardware. Some digerati, meanwhile, can't be blamed if their daily dose of Gphone vaportalk has left them more weary than wary. Beyond the Rumors "To tell you the truth, I try to tune out the Google rumor of the week," Gordon Haff, principal IT advisor for Illuminata, told LinuxInsider. As for the mobile phone-OS idea, "It would be nice if Google could pull it off, as it would plug them into all sorts of location-aware advertising," Haff added. The devil would revel in the details, however. "There's a huge gap between developing a technology and developing all the partnerships -- carriers, handset makers -- needed to exploit it," Haff said.

It would compromise the delivery of critical health information. It would impair the operations of providers of needed services. People would not be able to order goods online. The damage to the global economy would be incalculable. Many people would not be able to communicate with loved ones and friends. It would make working from home impossible. Loss of entertainment options could threaten mental health.
