Later, the adult Diana (Gadot) is further trained in combat by Themyscira warrior General Antiope, played by Robin Wright. Then American pilot Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) crashes on her land and warns Diana of a deadly threat to humanity. In the new footage we also see Diana travel with Trevor to England to help him fight against German General Erich Ludendorff (Danny Huston), who wants to use a gas weapon of mass destruction on the front lines of the WWI battlefield. In addition to many more battle scenes of Diana using her bracelets, sword and shield in battle, the trailer has a few comedic moments thrown in from Trevor's sassy secretary Etta Candy, played by Lucy Davis. On Friday, Gadot tweeted a new poster for the film showing Wonder Woman kneeling with her sword and shield in hand. Directed by Patty Jenkins, "Wonder Woman" is scheduled to hit theaters on June 2, 2017.
