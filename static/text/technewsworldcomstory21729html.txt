Learn how to create a more comprehensive security approach by examining the different approaches of password vaults and privilege management during this webinar. DoubleClick, which took a giant step into the campaign-management business with its November 2002 acquisition of Protagona, is seeking to make major strides in marketing automation by adding analytics and real-time capabilities to its software. The company's mission is to make marketing work better, Court Cunningham, senior vice president of marketing automation, told CRM Buyer. "Campaign management is a key piece of the marketing-automation dashboard," he said. The goal is to increase marketing efficiency, improve campaign intelligence and let users execute plans across multiple marketing channels. DoubleClick Ensemble 6.0, released in February, offers marketing tools to improve campaign flexibility, a new customizable user interface, open data architecture for accessing data from various sources, and advanced integration between modules. The company also has added thin-client capabilities to the software. Shoring Up the Foundation DoubleClick gained a good foundation in campaign management from Protagona and has enough money to invest in expanding its lineup, Forrester Research senior analyst Elana Anderson told CRM Buyer. However, she added, the company needs to play catch-up to compete against the likes of E.piphany, Unica and SAS. What is missing is integrated analytics that would allow business users to develop a propensity model, according to Anderson. "Once they have integrated analytics, they want to integrate real-time decision-making and offer-recommendation capabilities," she noted. "It's likely they will move first to a rules-based solution and then integrate analytics into the real-time piece." Adding integrated modeling capability would put DoubleClick on the map, but this is not apt to happen overnight, she said. "If they can do that in a short period, Unica will have a problem." Gradual Steps DoubleClick does have to differentiate itself, and that will take time, Cunningham admitted. Next year, the company will focus more on intelligence, including reporting and analytics functions. It also is exploring the possibility of adding data-management functions to Ensemble. In this year's fourth quarter, the company plans to release Ensemble 6.5, which will feature marketing segmentation tools and real-time functions, according to Cunningham. In addition, "pushbutton marketing" will enable marketers without advanced technical training to add their own predictive models. Ensemble 6.5 will be integrated with DoubleClick's e-mail and site analysis tools, Cunningham said. That is the right move, according to Anderson. DoubleClick has a strong ASP-based e-mail tool, but integrating it with the campaign-management application will take time, she explained. Raw Materials DoubleClick has the raw materials required for success in marketing automation, Gartner research director Gareth Herschel agreed. "But we'll see whether or not they can execute on it." Remaining on CIOs' and CMOs' short list will be a challenge, he told CRM Buyer. Since the Protagona acquisition, DoubleClick has signed seven marketing automation customers, ranging from traditional offline businesses to Internet businesses. For example, General Motors subsidiary OnStar will use Ensemble to manage its customer retention and upsell programs, while Lycos will use it to more efficiently market its products to users and encourage migration from free to paid content and services.

Data Issues nancya Posted 2010-06-09 Hey Dana, I agree -- this is all interesting stuff and very market indicative. Here's my question though . . . if Jigsaw collects its data via Crowdsourcing as opposed to a modeled data approach, how can they deliver clean data? The reason that I ask is that my sales team has used Jigsaw data in the past and it isn't very accurate. So, will SalesForce get a bloody nose over this if they can't clean up the data? I'd think that their clients would not be happy -- I know I wasn't and neither was my CEO. Any idea how they'll address this? Thanks! Excellent insight.

It would compromise the delivery of critical health information. It would impair the operations of providers of needed services. People would not be able to order goods online. The damage to the global economy would be incalculable. Many people would not be able to communicate with loved ones and friends. It would make working from home impossible. Loss of entertainment options could threaten mental health.
