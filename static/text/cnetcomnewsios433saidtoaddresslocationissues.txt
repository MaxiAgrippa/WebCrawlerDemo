Josh Lowensohn May 2, 2011 9:29 AM PDT Apple is said to be nearing completion on iOS 4.3.3, the software update that will address what Apple has called "bugs" that keep extended logs of locations stored on the iPhone and iPad. Boy Genius Report, which has been accurate about details of upcoming iOS versions ahead of release and claims to have a copy of the new software, says the new build fixes two of the issues Apple brought up in its location tracking missive from last week. Adjustments within the new update reportedly include: no longer backing up the subset of Apple's location database to the iOS device backup, reducing the size of the location database, and deleting the database when a user turns location services off from the phone's settings. These are all things Apple said would be addressed in an upcoming software update due in "the next few weeks." Along with those changes, BGR also claims the new build brings battery life improvements and bug fixes for iPod users. The new software is said to be shipping in the next week or two. There's no indication on which models will get it, though if Apple follows suit with past builds of iOS 4.3.X and higher, the iPhone 3G and second generation iPod Touch are likely to be left out.
