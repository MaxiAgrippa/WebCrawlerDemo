Absolutely. Hear experts from Forrester Research and Zurn Industries explain how the value of PIM goes beyond operational efficiencies and share why product content is critical for delivering a great customer experience. Watch the webinar. Last week, LinuxInsider published a story looking at the role of Groklaw.net, an informational Web site dealing with The SCO Group's lawsuits against Linux users and supporters. The story contained both expressions of support for, and criticism of, Groklaw and its founder-publisher Pamela Jones, including statements by SCO's public relations director, Blake Stowell. The story elicited a storm of protest and abuse from members of the open-source community, ranging from allegations of biased reporting to suggestions that its publishers were secretly in the service of proprietary software vendors. One criticism was that Jones was not given the opportunity to respond. The publishers feel that the story presented both sides and that its critics failed to distinguish between presenting the views of a party to a dispute, and endorsing them. Stowell's comments, it was felt, could stand or fall on their own merits. One of the legitimate demands contained in some readers' letters was that Stowell back up his allegation of "misconstrued and twisted" information on Groklaw with specifics. In fact, at our request, Stowell had provided an example, but time constraints prevented its inclusion in last week's story. Blake Stowell said: Here is one example. On January 27th, Pamela Jones chose to post a story from Newsforge that was written by Bruce Perens. In this story, Bruce suggested the following: That he has "assembled ample evidence that they [SCO] have lied under oath in court." Bruce Perens also wrote in this posting: "This virus [MyDoom] has been assembled for the purpose of defaming the Linux developers by spammers, SCO, or others." Has any specific evidence about SCO lying under oath actually been presented or come forward? Not to my knowledge. Has anyone found that SCO was actually the creator of the MyDoom virus? No. To even suggest that SCO was the creator of the virus I believe is ludicrous. This is one example of how in SCO's opinion, a lot of misinformation is posted on Groklaw. In the interests of fair debate, therefore, we present his example here and talked with Pamela Jones in an interview for her views on it and on other matters related to Groklaw, SCO and the continuing disputes. LinuxInsider: Pamela, what's your response to this example? Jones: I see no misinformation. Perens stated his opinions. SCO doesn't like it that the truth is out there, but it's out there. If he wishes to make a statement on Groklaw, stating his position in some matter, he's free to send it to me. I don't think the stated concern is sincere, though. I reserve the right to respond, naturally. LinuxInsider: In last week's story, Stowell made some serious insinuations about you, your motives and your backers, suggesting that you are secretly associated with IBM. What's your response? Jones: As I have said publicly elsewhere, I don't have any connection to IBM professionally or personally. I never have had any such connection. I have never even been inside an IBM building. They haven't given me any financial support of any kind. Not a dime. Not a promise. Not a grant. Not a PIPE deal. Not an envelope of money under the table from a cousin. Not a ThinkPad. Nothing. IBM does not sponsor Groklaw. Why, then, does SCO say that IBM sponsors Groklaw? They make the claim based on the fact that they say IBM gave some computer equipment to Ibiblio once upon a time. And Ibiblio hosts Groklaw for free. They have also been telling journalists that I live near IBM headquarters. That's it. That is IBM's "sponsorship." Wink, wink. Get it? By trying to get journalists to print where they think I live, they are putting me in danger. If you think I am exaggerating, take a look at what a SCO zealot posted on Yahoo's Finance message board, that if I was as pretty as [Julia Roberts playing] Erin Brockovich, he'd ... well, he seemed to have rape in mind. LinuxInsider: We've heard that judge Brooke Wells has criticized "trial by media" in the IBM case. What's your view of the proper role of media in reporting disputes such as this? Jones: SCO, in the most recent teleconference about the financials, said Wells told both sides to avoid remarks in the press. That seems unlikely to be precisely accurate. When did you last hear IBM say anything at all to the press about the case? Which side has been trying it in the media, in your experience? Why, then, would Wells tell IBM not to try it in the press? The media doesn't understand why people react when lies or falsehoods are printed. It's because people don't like lies and falsehoods. The tech media is used to Microsoft users, who mostly don't know their nose from their big toe when it comes to computers. So they don't react to stories with inaccuracies. People who use GNU/Linux know computers well, so they spot nonsense a lot quicker, and yes, I suppose they get sick of reading nonsense, particularly nonsense they perceive to have been written for hire, so to speak, with MS money in the background tilting the stories against FOSS. LinuxInsider: Finally, what's your view of SCO's choices of DaimlerChrysler and AutoZone as end users to sue? Jones: I think they have made a laughingstock of themselves. And I think that no one in their right mind will ever enter a contractual relationship with them again. These aren't really end-user lawsuits, though. As I've written, these are "uh oh, I was a SCO customer" lawsuits. This DaimlerChrysler thing has nothing to do with Linux, unless you see SCO as a scorned, toxic boyfriend who beats you up if you try to leave him and his Unix software and switch to GNU/Linux. AutoZone is accused of using shared libraries, but the guy who switched the company over to Linux posted on Groklaw a month ago that they didn't use any shared libraries, so I expect that means curtains for that lawsuit. Of course, it's early in the picture, but so far I see absolutely nothing that will stand.

Re: The Groklaw Story, Part Two Paul_Murphy Posted 2004-03-11 I read both stories and thought they were perfectly reasonable reportage, but then I'm a consulant, not a journalist and know little about the nuances of professional behavior in the field. On the other hand, the combination of your stories, the response to them, and too much time on my hands has sharpened my interest in a closely related question. That question is this: to what extent does IBM's marketing and public relations "machine" depend on what Stalin used to call "useful idiots?" A useful idiot, you may recall, is someone who does his master's bidding without being told to or directly compensated for his efforts - like John Kerry in his work for Hanoi. IBM used this appraoch extensively in selling mainframe Linux, quoting many nonsensical claims made by useful idiots ... Read More Reply Re: The Groklaw Story, Part Two phypor Posted 2004-03-12 You are not trolling. Although your statements sound rude, they are your serious beliefs and must be respected and refuted in an equally serious manner. * The first hole in your theory is related to timeframe. Mr. Perens was involved in Linux advocacy before IBM began any marketing of Linux services. Your 'useful idiot' theory (which also spins a nuance of impoliteness) only works if Mr. Perens' actions occured after the introduction of IBM influence into the Linux community. . The second hole is a bit more abstract. Ms. Jones does what she does because she thinks it is best for the Linux community. Currently IBM is acting in the community's best interests and that is why Ms. Jones' statments and actions support IBM. Subtle, but important. PJ can only be mistaken for a 'useful idiot' ... Read More Reply Re: The Groklaw Story, Part Two techtimestwo Posted 2004-03-11 Well, consider this: It's rare in life, I know, but there are some questions where the preponderance of truth lies on one side of the question. It is my opinion that the SCO lawsuits form one such time. Groklaw has published actual court documents and transcripts of press conferences and lectures where SCO has directly and repeatedly contradicted themselves. They say one thing to the press, and then directly deny it when pressed in court. What should be done in such a case? Not report it? Report is with "balance" by trying to find some dirt on IBM? If a spokesperson gets caught in a lie, why is it wrong to report that fact? So if IBM wants to make hay out of their opponents ineptitude, how is that a bad reflection on Groklaw. Groklaw started up independently to report on the SCO FUD. That IBM ...

IANALBIWAJ (I Am Not A Lawyer, But I Was A Journalist), and I know that, in journalism, there's a name for comments standing or falling on their own merits: a commentary. By wrapping the SCO commentary up with a lead, a bridge, a second-hand quote from the other side and other trappings of an actual news story, you legitimized their comments by making it seem they were being presented within the American tradition of journalism. But they weren't. The story had Ms Jones' name all over it, but you didn't give her a chance to respond. You didn't check any of the subject's facts (as far as a reader can tell), and you let bald assertions of conspiracy and other wrong doing go without a response. That's not balanced, that's ...

All whining and whinging and moaning aside, you have *ALL* missed the point - entirely. . (Q) What Is Groklaw? (a) It is a discussion site. . (Q) What does that mean? (a) There are postings of 'things to discuss' and there are subsequent postings which constitute 'the discussions'. . (Q) And that is relevant how? (a) no matter how much you dislike and/or disagree with 'the discussion' only the worst kind of moron would visit Groklaw and ignore the "things to discuss". . Groklaw includes as its primary articles (or however you wish to phrase "the initial postings to which all the subsequent discussions pertain") detailed literal quotations of *publicly available* information including ...

Not to my knowledge." A non sequiter. The fact that evidence has not been presented implies that it doesn't exist in which universe?? Bruce Perens:"This virus [MyDoom] has been assembled for the purpose of defaming the Linux developers by spammers, SCO, or others." Blake Stowell:"To even suggest that SCO was the creator of the virus I believe is ludicrous." Certainly no more ludicrous than the assertion by SCO, widely reported in the media and certainly at least tacitly held by Mr Stowell (my proof - he missed this opportunity to correct ... Read More Reply Re: The Groklaw Story, Part Two kedens Posted 2004-03-09 I follow groklaw quiet a bit (just not the user comments). It appears that some reporters are associating user comments with those of Pamela Jones. Although Pamela Jones is not un-biased about her oppinions she seems to always separate those opinions from the facts. I have seen many of her postings that stated that she is not sure if a particular source is acurate. This is a good clue for readers to know that what she is reporting may or may not be acurate and if it is later substantiated she generally lets you know. In my opinion she is completely un-biased when reporting facts, and she lets you know when she's stating her opinion. It is when people fail to fully investigate or read what she has written that problems arise. As for user comments, I think we all can agree that users on any site will say ... Read More Reply Where *exactly* is the balanced reporting in the first story? DarrenR114 Posted 2004-03-08 All I saw in your first story was quite a bit of Stowell running off at the mouth, or keyboard, as it were. I saw no balance. Stowell provided ONE example of what he felt was misinformation. However, I'd like to see him support that refutation with evidence. He says the Perens' quote was misinformation. I read the original. It was Perens expressing his opinion. Opinion is not misinformation. Stowell's characterization of it as misinformation is disingenuous considering the crap he spews. He also indicated that there were many examples - I have a feeling that his comment is like the "million lines of code" comment by McBride - ludicrous and untrue. By the way, how is it fair that Stowell's comments get featured in two articles and PJ's are featured in just one and still get cut ... Read More Reply Re: The Groklaw Story, Part Two sjworth Posted 2004-03-08 Granted PJ has has calmed down a bit compared to her post on Groklaw in responce to the first statement I find it disturbing that she implies SCO supporters are rapest based on a chat board. This shows she has an emotional commitment not toward IBM so to say but against SCO. I can't blame PJ for being upset at SCO FUD pointed in her direction, but, the reason I go to Groklaw is to look for facts not opinions or personal vendetas. PJ if you are reading this don't let yourself fall in to SCO's trap. They are trying to get you involved in something besides fact finding. They want to make Groklaw more of a tabloid than a site of good documentation. In doing so SCO lowers your sites credibility. Don't let this happen. Reply Re: The Groklaw Story, Part Two techtimestwo Posted 2004-03-08 "I find it disturbing that she implies SCO supporters are rapest based on a chat boar" That is not what she said. She said that by posting her location, SCO is making it possible for nut cases to potentially harrass her or even cause her harm, and then she gives one example of someone who actually is a supporter of SCO who made a threat against her. There is nothing wrong with her pointing this out, for it is a fact. She pointed it out calmly and reasonably too. Reply Re: The Groklaw Story, Part Two Curious Posted 2004-03-08 Mr. Halpern, The crux of my annoyance at your original Groklaw story and the current one is summed up by this quote: "The publishers feel that the story presented both sides and that its critics failed to distinguish between presenting the views of a party to a dispute, and endorsing them. Stowell's comments, it was felt, could stand or fall on their own merits." Where to start? First, and foremost is your head-spinning claim to have presented "both sides." Whoa, you present a detailed and totally erroneous set of claims by Stowell about Pamela Jones and you don't get her response? And then you call that presenting both sides? Breathtaking. Yes you later allowed Jones a response. How fair, after the fact. More fundamental is your common misconception that stories like the ...

Take every non-techinical fanatic, idiot, and 13 year old who wants to be a lawyer, and you've got Groklaw. Groklaw is about 100 recycled anti anything non-gpl opinions floating around. . Post ANYTHING that conflicts with their idealist views and you will be flamed to no end with idiotic accusations like "so, is this SCO trolling on our boards again". . If you read down a thread, almost every post starts out "IANAL" (I am not a lawyer), yet the next 500 words will be offering up their legal opinion on the matter. . PJ herself is so unprofessional it is incredible. Her opinions are always filled with wild conspiricy theories about how SCO and MS are trying to take over the world.

I am 28 years old, married, 2 children and a have nice middle class house, and income.

First of all, even PR ghouls must at least have a veneer of sentience. Secondly, They must be able to write. Also, you will need to graduate high school before getting a job with a PR firm. I take it from your apoplectic little tantrum that those brutes at Groklaw humiliated you inadvertantly - there ought to be a 'your clue must be at least this tall to surf this site' warning there for hapless shallow pans such as yourself. Doubtless you displayed some of the dazzling charm and wit you do here and got flamed. But then again, who cares? Since you clearly lack the conviction to shoot your mouth off at Groklaw, no one there need be annoyed by your ankle height aspersions. Good luck with puberty. Reply Re: The Groklaw Story, Part Two Nnyan Posted 2004-03-09 I suggest people just ignore bangular's post. Other then the ability to google for a few impressive (I was impressed, really) linux phrases he is SCO. Making claims with no foundations. If he really was a maintainer or widely respected contributer to any known open source project do you think really think he would not validate himself (besides not being able to intelligently discuss his differences with Groklaw or whomever)? A case of put up or shut up. After reading his posts and forming my own opinion on his credibility and possible motivations I simply ignore his posts and proceed to read other peoples commments.

The first time I saw IANAL on a discussion, my initial reaction was "Yeah, so many of us in this business are (anal, that is)." Sadly, 'bangular' doesn't add anything of substance to the discussion. It reminds me that "opinions are like a******s, everybody has one and they're mostly full of ***t." There now, I also have added nothing of substance. Reply Re: The Groklaw Story, Part Two Speedy145 Posted 2004-03-09 This is typical attacks on groklaw when one has nothing constructive to post.. why not debate something factual? I haven't read anything in this post that would convince a total madman.. Instead of attacking someone, read the documents themselves for yourself. from their own filings, contracts and court statments, also from their "press releases"..Nothing but barratry on a grand scale..Laywers post on here..

The posting of court documents in searchable text, public documents such as SEC filings, excellent articles posted by true Unix and Linux experts and excellent probing dialogue by a large contingent of intelligent posters. . What is true is that some people have posted on Groklaw with the intention of inflaming the dialogue - some of these posts are deleted as flamebait if they contain no facts or objective opinion. . Take the post of bangular as an example. Almost everything he says is pure flamebait.

Seeing that you continue to ring all three bells with your dunderheaded whining, I am not surprised if you have had your posts removed. I would also add that my original answer to your first witless ordinance was rejected by the moderators here, so I guess you now have the same problem with the site you are using for your soapbox. Which brings me to the most salient point: why do you cower in this backwater and cast aspersions at Groklaw when you could take them there? The answer is obvious - you are poultry stool. By all means, I think you should carry on here - it is an excellent recommendation for Groklaw that abrasive teenage thimblewits like yourself are weeded out and sent home to ...

Further, bangalor states that "Lot's of people who use open source don't like Groklaw." This "wild accusation" is not supported in fact. . Lastly, bangalor actually cites Rob Enderle as an authority "People like you are the exact ones people like Rob Enderle talk about." Really. .

Anyhow, I fail to see where a moniker like 'Bangular', devoid of meaning, is supposed to lend you an air of sophistication. Especially when it has become patently obvious here that you not only lack the spine to take your thumbsucking little beef to Groklaw, but you also couldn't debate a toddler without making a fool of yourself. Imitating Rant for Rent Rob like you do only underscores these points. Reply Re: bangular post... subdude Posted 2004-03-09 "I would be suprised if you are a day over 15."

If you had tried to elicit an uptime, you would have seen that server has been running long before this conversation. But alas, a 15 year old doesn't know how to do that... In fact, I think it's a bit hypocritical for someone to try and make the argument they are while running windows. But alas, that is what you are.

Read More Reply Re: bangular post... three-face Posted 2004-03-10 Nice attempt to backpedal out of making an idiot of yourself! Your continued use of vernacular in an attempt to appear to have a clue is akin to using your face to wipe the dog crap off of your shoe. Announcing that you have won an argument falls far short of actually winning. I sense that you are frustrated by the fact that so far no one has fallen for even one of your laughable assertions. There is no 'semantic' argument here - you simply revealed your complete ignorance of what you were talking about by saying that you run a 'Linux mailserver'. Your red-faced attempt to back away from this only underscores how desperately out of your depth you are. You say 'I proved you wrong' to subdude which, aside from torturing English, is yet another lie. Where did you meet his argument? Answer: ... Read More Reply Rebuttal techtimestwo Posted 2004-03-08 All me to point out what I think are inaccuracies in bangular's post re: Groklaw. He or she is certainly entititled to his or her opinion, and so am I. But since I have been reading Groklaw longer than bangular has, I might be able to offer a reasoned rebuttal. I have no way of knowing if bangular is a SCO/MS sympathizer. There are certainly SCO shills out there trying to discredit anyone who criticizes SCO, but let's take bangular at his/her word and assume that bangular really is a moderate Linux user who just wants all extremist positions to settle down into a more moderate tone. Groklaw idiotic and recycled? Completely false on the face of it, as anyone who visits Groklaw can plainly see. This is not another /., but a place where serious discussions occur and flame wars and script kiddies are ... Read More Reply Re: Rebuttal bangular Posted 2004-03-08 I find it comical for you to assume I've never visited the site, when in fact I had been visiting it since about 2 months after it launched. It used to be a place for SCO/MS related legal documents to be posted. That original goal has obviously been lost and has become a place for every conspiracy theory possible. I stopped visiting after Groklaw accused SCO of DoSing itself. I've been back a couple times only to find things have gotten worse. I can't help but remember reams of posts saying "If SCO isn't attacking themselves, why is their no backscatter". The manner in which those posts were recycled was amazing. Most didn't understand the situtation and just retold what others did. . And I would consider myself a little more than a moderate linux user as I have myself been in charge of ... Read More Reply Re: Rebuttal luser Posted 2004-03-08 Yes, yes, been in charge of many open source projects, currently run a rendering farm of 100 linux servers. . Such a bold individual to speak up and make a brave stand for the GNU/Linux community (anonymously). Oh yeah, it's GNU/Linux, in case you forgot (which you did). Not that I need to remind someone with at least a decade of 'linux' experience. . Why don't you take a moment out of your precious day and tell us a few of these 'many' open source projects you've been 'in charge' of? That way we can all reel in horror at being slammed by such 'linux' guru as yourself. . All I hear is: dude Groklaw sucks. no it doesn't. yes it does, and I should know because I'm a bigshot with lots of thingies. . Just the kind of retort one would expect from someone who considers /. to be ... Read More Reply Re: Rebuttal bangular Posted 2004-03-09 haha you know what, the fact that I'm probably arguing with a 13 year old speaks for itself. One whom is quick to resort to childish name calling. You can argue with yourself on this one. Because I'm willing to bet my 23 years unix experience is more than you have in your pinky. Reply Re: Rebuttal three-face Posted 2004-03-10 'More than you have in your pinky'? Although what you meant to say was probably something about having more experience in your pinky than whoever has in their whole body, your inability to pull even that trite retort out of the mothballs without screwing it up speaks volumes about your actual mental wattage. Regardless, I would still contend that luser probably does have more brains in his pinky than your ficticious '23 years' of Unix experience has afforded you. If you need evidence to that effect, try reading your own insipid, snot-faced skid marks in this forum. You've got me convinced. Reply Re: Rebuttal three-face Posted 2004-03-10 Bangular: So, instead of putting luser out of the race by revealing just which open source projects you helmed (sure, kid), you instead trot out this juvenile and disingenuous 'rebuttal', leaving his argument unmet. Happily, as luser pointed out, no one gives a rat's behind what you think anyhow. Too timid to take your vitriol to Groklaw, you smear it on the walls here like the witless poltroon you are. I will join in on your little fantasy world here by stating that my having created the known universe where once there was void trumps your uncontested mastery of self-pleasuring techniques. Reply Re: Rebuttal Slackattack Posted 2004-03-08 The issue is SCO's activities. Groklaw provides easy access to the source documents. Someone who gives her opinion on what it all means is a bonus. That someone writing with wit and an easy to read style makes the site even more attractive. . Yes it provides a forum for feedback, some of the feedback comes from lawyers, some from engineers and no doubt some from your average nutter. . They are fighting against a troll campain at the moment. Their solution may work better or worse than the solution adopted by slashdot. Their is no doubt however that the trolling effort has been sustained and vindictive. There is also no doubt that trolling has destroyed many a site, and is considered a successfull strategy to use against a site that offers a view that is not your own. Given the damage that can ... Read More Reply Re: Rebuttal techtimestwo Posted 2004-03-08 If anyone reading these comments wants to see how wrong bangular is, all you have to do is look at the first sentence of his or her reply: "I find it comical for you to assume I've never visited the site, when in fact I had been visiting it since about 2 months after it launched." Here is what I actually said: "But since I have been reading Groklaw longer than bangular has" See? He completely misconstrued my words into something I did not say. By the way, his comments confirm my assumption: I have been reading Groklaw longer than he/she has. The rest of what bangular said about Groklaw is either completely false or gross exaggeration of reality based on his or her perception. Do yourself a favor, read Groklaw and make up your own mind. bangular is flat out wrong, as the ... Read More Reply Re: The Groklaw Story, Part Two Curious Posted 2004-03-08 "Take every non-techinical fanatic, idiot, and 13 year old who wants to be a lawyer, and you've got Groklaw." Wrong. You are obviously missing the forest for the trees. You've commented on the discussion section. Your characterizations are wrong, in my opinion, but you could have even made them on Groklaw. Groklaw is a repository of documents far more than it is a discussion site. Jones is careful to explain the difference between her analysis of documents and statements and what a lawyer might say. If you didn't understand that, you weren't trying. Reply Re: The Groklaw Story, Part Two tungtung Posted 2004-03-08 Dear Mr. Halperin, . As a Linux user, I think I can identify exactly what it is about your work that upsets us so terribly. In the above piece you quote Stowell about a story published on Newsforge and quoted in Groklaw. Unfortunately, (and this lack of research is where you make the Linux enthusiasts really angry) you haven't investigated Stowell's story at all. What date was the story Stowell referrs to quoted on Groklaw? What parts of the story did PJ quote, and were they the same portions of the story that Stowell quotes? What did PJ have to say about that Newsforge story? Did she agree with Peren's point of view or did she simply use it as an example of how people view SCO? . These are all important and relevant questions which directly relate to Stowell's credibility, but instead of ...
