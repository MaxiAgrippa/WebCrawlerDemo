John Borthwick & Matt Hartman of betaworks discuss coronavirus adaptation strategies – TechCrunch John Borthwick & Matt Hartman of betaworks discuss coronavirus adaptation strategies Jordan Crook @jordanrcrook / 9 hours Yesterday, I had the pleasure of hopping on Zoom with betaworks’ John Borthwick and Matt Hartman to discuss the tech world’s adaptation to this new locked-down world, the future of new media and answer questions from the audience. We discussed whether new media companies can raise capital right now, and touched on emerging trends around audio, voice, AR, live events, travel-related companies and many other topics. It was a delight, and I’m excited to do more of these in the future. For those of you who missed the Zoom, here’s a rundown of what we discussed (audio embed below).
