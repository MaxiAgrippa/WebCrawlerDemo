Nimble has introduced a new Software as a Service social CRM platform designed to enable social engagement. Nimble 2.0 empowers companies to get closer to their customers through listening and engagement, helping them turn their social communities into customers for life, according to the company. Features include social discovery, improved usability and marketing integration. "Most people simply don't use their CRM systems," Jon Ferrara, Nimble CEO and founder of GoldMine, a pioneering CRM product, told CRM Buyer. "They're just dead databases they type into, and most people that do that aren't database professionals. Nimble goes to the heart of the issue and provides a platform for individuals and teams to build relationships through engagement." While social media is often "bolted onto" legacy platforms, "you still have to warp out your CRM application to actually engage with those people," he added. "What CRM should be doing is tying everything together and bringing in what people are saying and their activities, and connect them for you and your team. What we're doing with this service is fixing the 'R' in CRM." Social Engagement Key social engagement features include support for Facebook business pages and Google+ support that enables companies to listen and engage their customers while tracking and capturing real-time data when fans interact on social streams. Nimble's unified social notifications capability consolidates all the likes, comments, friend invites and other social interactions from LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook and Google+ so that users don't have to go to five separate tabs to engage with their customers and prospects. These new features are combined with alerts on birthdays, promotions and job changes in a daily email notification. The Nimble contact record pulls together all related messages, activities, and deals, and includes the contact's live social stream. Nimble also features integration with HubSpot to enable closed-loop marketing. Nimble is free for standalone personal users. Business and multi-users can sign up for Nimble at US$15 per user per month.
