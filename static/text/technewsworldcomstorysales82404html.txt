Learn how to create a more comprehensive security approach by examining the different approaches of password vaults and privilege management during this webinar. It felt like back to school this week at the CRM Evolution show in hot and muggy New York. The first week or two of the school year is always like that. Though it still feels like summer vacation, you know you have to get focused, because the first exam will be here before you know it. Cramming begins almost immediately, because some years are just busier than others, and there seem to be a lot of new ideas percolating. A dawning realization occurred to me: Business is awakening to the idea that we've pushed on the business-as-transaction string long enough, and the route to front office progress will be through process orientation from now on. At least I think so, and I've said as much at every opportunity. The 'P' Word To be clear, it's my perspective that the business world is in more of a zero-sum situation right now than a place of open fields for new categories of products. Buyers are well into their next up-purchases of all kinds of products, and gaining new customers beyond organic growth means taking them away from a competitor. To do that -- or just to hang on to the ones you have -- requires using the same approaches. Businesses increasingly are relying on selling whole products, which means continuing engagement well past the transaction. It also means having and promoting business processes that demonstrate a desire to support customers in every way possible. This is the process revolution taking shape, and it came home to me most clearly as I listened to Bob Stutz, Microsoft CVP of Dynamics CRM, being interviewed by old pal and CRM ninja master Paul Greenberg. Stutz was not afraid to use the "process" word liberally in his discussion of where the industry was going, and I thought that was very interesting. Also, I was part of a breakfast panel led by Greenberg, where plenty of respected analysts -- Kate Leggett, Mike Fauscette, Brian Vellmure, Brent Leary, Ray Wang and others -- nibbled around the idea. I think "nibbled" is a good word here, because process is a big idea, and it will take a while to get things straight. Start Taking Notes Process is important, because if it is more than a late summer fad, it will mean that we need to rethink CRM fundamentally. Luckily, many of the tools and technologies that have been hitting the market in the last few years will contribute to the success of process orientation. Things like journey maps, analytics, big data, social, collaboration and other stuff all have a role to play in supporting businesses, as they strive to be more relevant to customers by being in their moments of truth. The technology needed to support the transition is available now, for the most part, but we still don't have many narratives that explain the how and why of it. Lacking such a narrative is often the thing that prolongs the adoption curve, turning it into a hype cycle. There's no need for that this time, because many of the people I referenced above have clear insights -- even books. Nevertheless, it will take some proof points (read ROI stories) from vendors to make it safe for businesses to plunk down their IT dollars. The proof points are out there -- and most vendors have the ability to articulate their own, though most have not done so yet. I attribute this to it still being late summer. School for the CRM-minded has just started, but keep in mind that Dreamforce is in mid-September, not long from now, and Oracle OpenWorld comes just after that in October. I expect to see much more process-oriented messaging before the first exam comes around. Denis Pombriant is a well-known CRM industry researcher, writer and speaker.
