Technology CES 2014: The coolest gadgets from day two of the Consumer Electronics Show By Kate Wilkinson January 7, 2014 Gallery CES Day 2 6 / 7 Hothead Technologies Spree Fitness Monitor While I'm not sure we'll be seeing this being worn around the gym any time soon, the Spree Fitness Monitor does offer an interesting alternative for those who have to measure their heart rate during a workout. It keeps track of movement, calories burned and body temperature in real time while you're exercising—a quick glance at your phone will tell you how many calories you've worked off and if it's necessary to pick up the pace. I'm not certain this will see mass consumer adoption, but the Spree aims to be more comfortable than heart monitors that require you to strap them around your chest. So if heart-rate monitoring is a must for your workout, this may be a bit more comfy (although not quite as subtle).
