Apple has had better days, and I used to be able to read my email during those better days. Matt Asay July 11, 2008 2:14 PM PDT I wrote earlier about how great the new Apple ActiveSync integration works. To a point, that's true. My calendar and contacts have been syncing flawlessly on my iPhone. But email? Well.... Half the time that I click on an email it bumps me back to my home screen (and resets email so that the server needs to push it back to the phone). I have no idea what is going on, but I've re-created my IMAP account until Apple figures out the problems. I'm a huge Apple fan. Today, however, I couldn't be more disappointed. I keep seeing pretty, shiny things...and then finding out they're iCrap underneath.
