Apple has seen a record number of iPhone sales this year, and the company shows no signs of putting on the brakes -- it allegedly just upped its order of handset units from 50 million to 56 million, including orders for the not-officially-announced iPhone 5. The increased order doesn't seem unrealistic given Cupertino's exponential iPhone sales growth and strong market performance over the past year. Rumors of the iPhone 5's release are also fueling the possible uptick in sales. The handset could make its debut in late fall. "The market seems to be anticipating something in October," Alex Gauna, managing director of technology research at JMP Securities, told MacNewsWorld. The orders include shipments of the iPhone 4 and 3GS, reportedly 20 million for the third quarter and then dropping down in the fourth, so Apple presumably plans to keep the older models alive as lower-price options. Apple didn't respond to MacNewsWorld's requests for further comment. iPhone's Sales Secret: Traveling Apple's phone platform remains a favorite in the U.S., but it's sitting at the No. 2 spot in smartphone platform sales after Google's Android. That's part of the reason Apple has set its sights on emerging markets and seen such positive growth. "Emerging markets are huge. That's where the majority of their momentum is right now. Growth is somewhat plateaued in North America, so that's where they're really getting their footing," said Gauna. South Korea, Japan, Germany, Israel and Malaysia are big players in the company's growth, but China is where Apple is really seeing sales boom for both the iPhone and the iPad, so that where it wants to focus its attention. "Apple is continuing to grow and added 40 carriers last quarter, a lot of that driven by the iPhone target in Korea, Japan and China, so the emerging markets are critical. China is definitely going to be huge in the mobile market, so that can be very material to their iPhone shipment and great news for them," Scott Sutherland, managing director of research at Wedbush Securities, told MacNewsWorld. With sales in that geographic segment growing steadily -- up 247 percent over the past year in the second quarter and accounting for 22 percent of sales for that time period -- there's no saying what will stop Apple from becoming a significant tech force overseas. "Internationally they have about 200 carriers, so I think people have discounted how much global expansion they can still do," said Sutherland. This Week in Patents No week in the technology world seems complete without a patent dispute, and one of the biggest patent fights recently has centered on Germany, where Apple's legal team has found itself embroiled in a complex lawsuit with Samsung. A temporary injunction had been placed on Samsung's tablet, the Galaxy Tab 10.1, in all of Europe with the exception of the Netherlands over the similarities between it and the iPad 2. The injunction has since been partially lifted after the court expressed doubt as to whether it had the power to ban a South Korean company from selling in places other than Germany, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal. However, another twist has been added to the battle. Apple's team has allegedly presented flawed evidence in the case. A screen shot offered by Apple was supposed to show photographic evidence that the two products were nearly identical, but the photo of the Galaxy Tab wasn't true to life, according to Dutch publication Webwereld. The measurements were reportely off, making the iPad and the Tab seem more similar in size than they actually are. The apparent mistake, whether accidental or not, highlights the increasingly complex legal battles that critics say are crippling the industry. A recent public tiff between legal heads at Google and Microsoft regarding patents shows how bitter the intellectual property wars are becoming, but Apple seems to be in a pretty solid place going forward. "I think it's weighing down the entire industry, especially companies with weaker patents like HTC and Google. But Apple on the iPhone had significant patents, so I think that is very critical. They're pretty well-balanced compared to the industry on average. They're able to use their patents when they need it and have enough to defend themselves," said Sutherland.
