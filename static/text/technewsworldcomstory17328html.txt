Grant • E-Commerce Times • ECT News Network Apr 18, 2002 9:24 AM PT Webinar: Unlocking the Potential of Password Vault Alternatives Understanding the differing Privileged Access Management solutions can be a challenge, especially for Linux of UNIX environments. Learn how to create a more comprehensive security approach by examining the different approaches of password vaults and privilege management during this webinar. In an effort to improve the quality of online information and strengthen consumers' faith in the Web, Consumers Union -- the consumer advocacy group that publishes Consumer Reports magazine -- has moved its system of objective ratings to the Web. The group's new site is called Consumer WebWatch. "As consumers settle into the realities of a world where the Internet has changed many aspects of how they live their lives, they are starting to question more and more how much they should trust Web content," said Beau Brendler, director of Consumer WebWatch. The site earlier commissioned a survey of 1,500 adult Web users. Just 29 percent of respondents said they trust Web sites that sell products or services. Set of Guidelines The new site has established a set of guidelines on a number of points, including whether a site is up-front about transaction fees, business partnerships and sponsorship; who owns the site and where it is located; how well a site explains its privacy policy; whether advertising is clearly labeled as such and is kept separate from editorial content; and how the site uses personal data provided by customers. The guidelines also include things like whether a site is diligent about correcting wrong or misleading information and whether it uses cookies or other tracking devices. Rated on Compliance The group said it plans to develop specific guidelines for various online sectors, including travel, health, financial, search engines, portals and children's sites. After it has come up with a complete set of guidelines, it will begin rating Web sites based on their compliance. Consumer WebWatch also will provide news and research on how consumers use the Web and will encourage adoption of best practices by Web sites. The Big Question The consumer group's task seems herculean, however, and a question remains: How effective will it be? "It's hard to tell what exact value the ratings system will have for consumers at this point," Forrester Research analyst Chistopher Kelley told the E-Commerce Times. According to Kelley, Web credibility is still a problem -- almost half of online consumers still do not make purchases over the Internet because of issues like credit card security and privacy. But Web site ratings are not a new idea, and previous attempts to establish such a system have not caught on. In addition, consumers already can take a number of steps to protect themselves by using ad-blocking software, privacy software and one-time-use credit card numbers. "These are all specific solutions that help consumers get over their online hurdles, yet most people don't use them," Kelley said. That said, more information cannot hurt. "The more information that is out there to help consumers make more informed choices, the better," Kelley said.
