YouTube TV and Sling TV are the two best options for cord cutters who want live TV. Here's how to choose between them. Ty Pendlebury February 12, 2020 4:00 AM PST Leer en español YouTube TV ($50) $50 at YouTube TV Sling TV ($30) $35 at Sling So you have Netflix, Amazon Prime and Disney Plus but you want to bolster your binge-watching sessions with actual live TV channels such as ESPN, TNT and CNN. Or maybe you've decided it's time to cut the cable TV cord to save money and hassle, but you don't want to lose live news and sports. In both cases Sling TV and YouTube TV are your best bets. We've tested all seven of the major live TV-streaming services and those two came out on top. Both won CNET's Editors' Choice award and both do largely the same thing: stream a bunch of channels live to your Roku, Amazon Fire TV or Apple TV streamer or smart TV so you can ditch the cable box once and for all. So how do you choose between them? If money isn't a concern then YouTube TV is best choice, with more channels and an excellent cloud DVR. Unfortunately it costs $50 per month. Budget-level Sling TV is the superior value at just $30 per month, with roughly half as many channels and just a basic cloud DVR. Here's how they stack up.

It may not have every channel you want, and some add-ons like HBO aren't available, but nonetheless it's the current gold standard of live TV streaming. Read our YouTube TV review.

It's not as comprehensive or as easy to navigate as YouTube but with a bit of work, including adding an antenna or an AirTV 2 DVR, it's an unbeatable value. Read our Sling TV review.

Signing up for the basic Sling TV is cheap but the costs pile up once you start adding channels or features. It costs an extra $5 a month for a DVR, for example, or $5 to add packages such as Comedy, Sports and Kids, which include extra channels such as TV Land, NBA TV and Disney Junior, respectively. It's worth noting that Sling TV is currently offering discounts for the first month: Blue or Orange for $5, or you can get Orange & Blue for $20. YouTube TV: YouTube TV costs $50 and doesn't offer any add-on channel packages, although it does have a handful of single-channel add-ons including Showtime and EPIX. This one-price approach mitigates the paralysis of choice a little bit.

Sarah Tew/CNET Channels: YouTube wins hands-down YouTube TV offers almost twice the number of channels of Sling Blue, in addition to the major local channels (including PBS) in most markets. Sling TV offers few to no local channels, depending on your package and where you live. Sling Blue offers Fox and NBC in a handful of major markets but the Orange package has none. Why get Orange at all? If you want ESPN. But if you want a few more channels (and live in the right market for the local channels) then Blue might be more enticing. Sling's $40 Orange & Blue package combines the two packages but as it only adds four more channels out of the 100 most popular (including ESPN and Disney) it represents fairly poor value. Get YouTube TV instead. You can check see how the YouTube TV and Sling differ in their channel lineups in this handy chart, or just scroll to the end of this article, but here's a quick summary of the main missing channels: Major channels missing from Sling Orange: ABC, CBS, Fox, NBC, Bravo, Animal Planet, Fox News, FS1, FX, MLB Network, MSNBC, Nickelodeon, USA Network Major channels missing from Sling Blue: ABC, CBS, Animal Planet, Disney Channel, ESPN, Fox News, MLB Network, Nickelodeon Major channels missing from YouTube TV: A&E, Comedy Central, History, Lifetime, Nickelodeon The Sling TV live guide is pretty uninspiring. Sarah Tew/CNET Usability: Pretty much a tie The YouTube TV interface on Roku. Sarah Tew/CNET The menus and interfaces on both are relatively drab, especially in the Roku versions. YouTube TV: In general the YouTube TV interface is easier to use, and not just to people used to using regular YouTube. If you're using the desktop or app versions, Google's streamer offers a more streamlined structure that's also nicer on the eye. Sling TV: While Sling has shaved down the number of button presses needed to watch a live show from the guide -- three down to two -- it's still more than YouTube TV's one. The difference in number of simultaneous streams is worth noting, especially for families and other households who watch a lot of TV. YouTube TV lets you stream to three different devices -- say the living room TV, a bedroom TV and a tablet -- at the same time. So does Sling TV Blue. But with Sling TV Orange you can only watch one stream at a time. Trading up to Sling TV's Orange & Blue package delivers up to four streams at once, but only one of them can be from an Orange-only channel. You still can't watch ESPN on two separate TVs simultaneously, for example. YouTube TV's biggest usability advantage is its excellent cloud DVR. It's included in the cost, offers unlimited storage and works great, much like the hardware DVR inside your cable box. Sling TV also offers a cloud DVR but it only has 10 hours of storage; upping that to 50 hours (and adding the ability to "protect" recordings from erasure) costs an extra $5 per month.

The costs of both services are relatively affordable, especially compared to many cable TV packages -- although at $50 YouTube TV is inching closer to cable bundle territory, albeit without any contracts. If you want to save the most money, Sling TV offers a compelling mix of cable-only programming. However, if you want a cable TV-like experience with greater channel selection, local channels and the addition of a DVR, YouTube TV is worth the additional $20 per month. Channel comparison Below you'll find a chart that's a smaller version of this massive channel comparison. It contains the top 100 channels from each service. Some notes: Yes = The channel is available on the cheapest pricing tier. That price is listed next to the service's name. No = The channel isn't available at all on that service. $ = The channel is available for an extra fee, either a la carte or as part of a more expensive package or add-on. Not every channel a service carries is listed, just the "top 100" as determined by CNET's editors. Minor channels like AXS TV, CNBC World, Discovery Life, GSN, POP and Universal Kids didn't make the cut. Regional sports networks -- channels devoted to showing regular-season games of particular pro baseball, basketball and hockey teams -- are not listed. In general YouTube TV has more RSNs but it varies widely by area. To find out if your local RSN is available you can search YouTube TV by zip code here and search Sling TV by team or zip code here.
