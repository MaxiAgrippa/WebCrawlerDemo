Sean Keane June 12, 2019 1:39 AM PDT Apple has sufficient iPhone production capacity outside China to meet the needs of the US market. Angela Lang/CNET Apple is reportedly prepared if the US-China trade war forces it to move production outside China. Its Taiwanese manufacturing partner Hon Hai Precision Industry (better known as Foxconn) can make enough iPhones to meet the needs of Apple's US market outside China if needed, according to Bloomberg. Most iPhones are currently produced in China, but Foxconn semiconductor division chief Young Liu apparently told investors Tuesday that 25% of its production capacity is outside the mainland -- enough to satisfy the US market.

"Foxconn follows a strict company policy of not commenting on any matters related to current or potential customers, or any of their products," a company spokesperson said in an emailed statement. Last week, Apple CEO Tim Cook expressed confidence that the company's products will escape fallout from the trade war. Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.
