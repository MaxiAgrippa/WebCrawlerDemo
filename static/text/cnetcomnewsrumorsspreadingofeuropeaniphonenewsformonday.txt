Tom Krazit June 29, 2007 1:36 PM PDT Europeans are going to have to wait for their iPhone until later this year, but good things might be coming to those who wait. Newswireless.net reported Friday (thanks Engadget) that Apple will announce on Monday the European carriers it has chosen for the launch of the iPhone across the pond. Vodafone, T-Mobile and Carphone Warehouse will be named as Apple's launch partners, according to Newswireless.net, and they will have a faster 3G phone to offer their customers. Who will carry the iPhone in Europe? We might find out as early as Monday. Apple The EDGE network used for the iPhone in the U.S. is probably the most widely cited problem with Apple's first iteration of the device. EDGE is akin to dial-up speeds in many cities, and it can take forever to download a home page. Watching a streaming video? Not gonna happen. Apple CEO Steve Jobs has defended the selection of the EDGE network by pointing out that 3G networks are not deployed very widely in the U.S. But that's not the case in Europe, where data phones have been around for years. Apple is probably too smart to foist an EDGE phone on this market, which would probably also mean they have a 3G version in the works for the U.S. market. We shall see.
