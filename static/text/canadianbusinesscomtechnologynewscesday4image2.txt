Technology CES 2014: The coolest (and silliest) gadgets from day four of the Consumer Electronics Show By Kate Wilkinson January 9, 2014 Gallery CES Day 4 2 / 10 Reebok Reebok Checklight Reebok has already received an innovation award for debuting this product at CES 2014, and for good reason. This small cap can be worn on its own or under a helmet, and measures the impact that an athlete's head receives throughout a game or performance. The small tag rests on the back of the wearer's neck, and lights up in green, yellow or red (red meaning a large, potentially dangerous level of impact) when the athlete comes into contact with someone or something. It records the data and also keeps track of the number of hits the wearer has taken. Hopefully it will be used as a research tool in ongoing efforts to learn more about and prevent serious head injuries in sports.
