Mello Jr. Jan 21, 2016 7:00 AM PT Webinar: Unlocking the Potential of Password Vault Alternatives Understanding the differing Privileged Access Management solutions can be a challenge, especially for Linux of UNIX environments. Learn how to create a more comprehensive security approach by examining the different approaches of password vaults and privilege management during this webinar. Two white-hat hackers, Charlie Miller and Chris Valasek, made headlines last year when they demonstrated how they could hijack the control systems of a moving motor vehicle over the Internet. The move got the attention of the auto industry, and last week General Motors put in place a program to encourage more digital dabblers to alert the company when they find bugs in GM vehicles. Working with HackerOne, GM published a set of guidelines for submitting flaws to the company. The guidelines, though, mostly describe what a bug finder must do to avoid prosecution. For example, it advises researchers that they must not cause harm to GM customers or others; compromise the privacy or safety of customers; violate any criminal laws; reveal bugs until GM fixes them; be a resident of Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, Syria or Crimea; and be on the U.S. Treasury Department's Specially Designated Nationals List. There's no mention in the guidelines that GM will compensate researchers for the hours of work typically spent uncovering vulnerabilities in software. Demonstrating Leadership "Working with hackers begins by having a clear way for potential vulnerabilities to be responsibly reported," said HackerOne CTO Alex Rice. "A vulnerability coordination process is an important security best practice for every technology company," he told TechNewsWorld. "General Motors is demonstrating leadership in their field with this commitment." Ben Johnson, chief security strategist for Bit9 + Carbon Black, also praised GM's initiative. "It's a wise move to try and get a whole community to crowdsource the problem," he told TechNewsWorld. However, the popularity of the program remains uncertain, he said. "It will be interesting to see how many contribute versus how many take their chances and go rogue." No Rewards Program The GM initiative lacks an important component of bug-bounty programs. "It's not a bug-bounty program unless you're offering rewards," said Casey Ellis, CEO of Bugcrowd. "To call something a bug-bounty program when there's no reward devalues the work that the researchers are doing." GM's initiative is a vulnerability disclosure program, he told TechNewsWorld. It's creating a way for researchers to let GM know when a bug is discovered. "They want to show they're not hostile to what the researchers are doing," Ellis said. "That's a step in the right direction, but rewards would be better because they place the proper value on the research that's being done." Bribe Bounties While GM may not be paying bounties for bugs, it may be paying for them though other means, maintained Johannes Hoech, CMO of Identity Finder. "Someone should ask GM how much they're paying in bribes already," he told TechNewsWorld. "Companies pay this money all the time. Legit bug-bounty programs are essentially an attempt to legally harness what otherwise would continue to be illegal activities," Hoech said. "Beating the PR drums around suing researchers is useless and ineffective, because the folks that might respond to that threat are not the ones GM has to worry about anyhow," he noted. "In the meantime," Hoech continued, "they miss out from the near-free intelligence that could be gathered via legit bug-bounty programs." DDoS Extortion Europol last week announced that it carried out a major operation in December against a criminal gang that's been combining two popular cyberthreats: distributed denial-of-service attacks and digital extortion. During a worldwide operation against a group called DD4BC, Europol arrested a main target, detained another suspect, and, through multiple searches, seized an extensive amount of evidence, the agency said. "This particular group is notorious and well-known in the security community," said Rene Paap, product marketing manager at A10 Networks. "They're talented cybercriminals with vast resources," he told TechNewsWorld. "They've been drawing attention to themselves because they're doing DDoS for ransom compared to hacktivists who do it to draw attention to a cause," Paap added. Mitigation Cheaper Than Ransom DD4BC launches DDoS attacks against targets that are dependent on their online presence for their main revenue streams. After proving what they can do, the cybercriminals make a ransom demand, he said. "They say if you don't pay up today, the attacks will continue and the ransom will double," Paap said. Paying that ransom doesn't make a lot of sense, noted Tim Matthews, vice president of marketing at Imperva. "First, there is no guarantee that the criminal will honor the agreement. Second, paying will only identify you or your organization as a mark, and the criminal may come back and ask for more," he told TechNewsWorld. "Once identified as an organization that will pay, others may catch wind and come your way," Matthews added. "In general," he said, "DDoS mitigation services are available for monthly fees that are less than ransom amounts."
