Watch Now » Skyfire, an app from Skyfire Labs, is available for US$2.99 at the App Store. A funny thing happened at the iTunes App Store last week. An app called Skyfire "sold out." This collection of code -- which could theoretically be copied an infinite number of times at no cost save for that of bandwidth and electricity -- was suddenly the Tickle-Me-Elmo of the direct-download software world. The cupboard was bare. The term "sold out" suggests Skyfire is in high demand, which is true. It's not "Angry Birds" popular, but it's in the App Store's top 10 as of this writing. It offers something that iPhone users have never been able to get before, despite all the features and improvements Apple's added to its smartphone over the past three and a half years: a Web browser that plays Flash videos. Even though Flash is still used, Apple thinks it's old and busted as a Web video standard. Instead, Apple promotes HTML5, though that standard's still in its early stages of adoption. Back to that "sold out" business, though -- that was the explanation from the company that made the app, its attempt to explain why its product was suddenly unavailable after only a few hours in the App Store. Of course, Skyfire couldn't possibly have sold out in the traditional sense. Apps don't arrive on trucks to be stored in the stockroom until supplies are exhausted. Perhaps Skyfire Labs was just trying to tell the world, "We have to take the app down for a little while. But we want to be clear that Skyfire hasn't been banned by Apple. It's just not available right now. Come back some other time, please." Later, the company explained that the servers it uses to deliver Flash were buckling under high demand, so allowing more people download the app and add to the frenzy would have guaranteed a lousy experience for everyone and plenty of one-star reviews in the store. But after what I can only guess was an all-nighter scale-up effort, Skyfire seems to be back for now, perhaps permanently. Sometimes Flashy, Sometimes Less So Circumstances of Skyfire's debut aside, the app really does play Flash video -- usually. I was accused of not having the latest version of Flash once or twice, and this app is not built to handle Flash games or animation (sorry, Homestar, ol' bud). Also, according to the app's FAQ, "Flash for video playback is used in vastly different ways on different sites. We are rapidly expanding the list of supported players and sites as we come across them, but not all will work right away. Thank you for your patience!" So yes, you will find some sites where the video just won't play. When you do find a page with supported Flash video, a popup window with a Play (triangle) button will appear on the bottom half of the screen. Tap the button and you're taken to a video frame. There's an optimization and buffering process that takes a few seconds, then comes the video. Skyfire's play controls are a bit different than those you'll typically find in Safari-friendly streaming videos. There's Play/Pause, of course (though if I'm reading the FAQ right, some videos won't even support Play/Pause -- if they're out there, I didn't find any). Other play controls strike me as a little off-kilter in most videos. The slider control at the top goes between "--:--" and "Live," and it never really lets me control the exact place in the video I want to go to, even if some additional buffering is required. It sometimes takes me perhaps 20 seconds into the past, but I can never fast-forward to the end of a video unless I've already either watched the whole thing or kept it paused for a long duration. The Skip button presumably takes me to the furthest-buffered point in the vid (what I suppose "Live" is), but the position of the slider will continue to jerk around. Where am I? Not sure. There's also what appears to be a 30-second rewind button on the control menu, but I've never once been able to activate it. Do precise playback controls matter when it comes to bite-sized Web videos? Skyfire's are definitely wonky, but that could have less to do with app design and more with the many different ways Flash is implemented, per the FAQ from above. A Stand-Up Browser Aside from Flash playback, Skyfire's a standard mobile browser with nearly all the same features iPhone users have come to expect from using Safari. There are settings for bookmarks, opening new tabs, and sharing via email (or Facebook or Twitter, if you prefer). All of these are set along the bottom of the screen, just like in Safari. Along the top is the standard URL bar and a search bar, also arranged a la Safari. Searches can be done through Google, Wikipedia or Skyfire's own video search utility. The Settings menu (shaped like a gear in the upper right corner) will take you a page with some interesting options: "Load page as" lets you toggle between loading a site's mobile page or desktop page by default, instead of making you scroll down to the bottom and search out a link to "standard version" amongst all the fine print. "Private Browsing" lets you surf without retaining history or cookies. Digging deeper into settings lets you turn off that video alert pop-up (meaning Flash videos on a page won't be flagged to your attention) as well as set your home page, manually clear your history/cookies/cache, send in feed-back and log out of Facebook if you've used it to post a link. Bottom Line Skyfire isn't a complete and perfect remedy for users who want Flash video on their iPhones. Some videos work, some do not, and its play controls are just screwy sometimes. But some of the time -- MOST of the time that I used it, in fact -- it does indeed get that Flash video to your screen. In order to avoid heartbreak and disappointment, approach each video with knowledge that failure is a constant possibility. However, as I went around the Web looking for videos to test Skyfire with, it occurred to me that this lack of native Flash on the iPhone is nowhere near as much of an annoyance as it once was. The built-in YouTube app had that channel nailed down from the get-go, and later Google redesigned its mobile site so that you don't even need the app to do YouTube -- it'll play straight through Safari if you want. Other sites have followed suit. Top-shelf Web video providers have taken the third-party app route. Netflix's app will play your streaming queue right through your phone (not that Skyfire would have helped -- Netflix's site uses Silverlight). And even though Hulu's iPhone app has less free (non-Hulu Plus) content than its desktop site, that's still not a point for Skyfire, because Hulu doesn't run on Skyfire. For mobile video junkies, Skyfire will come in handy for when you happen upon a video that won't play nice with Safari. But it seems those types of clips are getting rarer by the day.
