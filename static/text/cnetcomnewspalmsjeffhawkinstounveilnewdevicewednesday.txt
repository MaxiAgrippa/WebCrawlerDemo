Tom Krazit May 29, 2007 12:13 PM PDT Palm sent out a teaser to the media Tuesday, dropping word that company founder Jeff Hawkins will introduce "a new category of mobile device" at the D: All Things Digital conference on Wednesday. Jeff Hawkins has a new mobile gadget to show. Numenta No further details were provided. Hawkins invented the Palm Pilot, the ubiquitous personal digital assistant of the 1990s, and left Palm to found Handspring's development of the Treo. Hawkins is currently working at a start-up called Numenta with former colleague and Palm co-founder Donna Dubinsky. Perhaps Hawkins has Palm's answer to Apple's iPhone, or some new product that will heighten the speculation that Palm is a takeover candidate. He'll have to have come up with something huge to steal the conference spotlight from the Steve Jobs-Bill Gates joint appearance scheduled for later on Wednesday.
