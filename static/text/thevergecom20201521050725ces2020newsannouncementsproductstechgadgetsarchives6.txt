The overall theme was concepts, our staff determined when deliberating the annual Verge Awards at CES 2020, which meant a lot of show without a lot of substance: This year, the things that stole attention at the show were not early looks at products that you and I will be able to actually use and buy over the next 12 months. Sure, there’s the occasional laptop and meat substitute that will be available for purchase in 2020. But for every one of those, there’s a rolling ball robot, virtual personal attendant, or entire vehicle that is never likely to ship. Our Best in Show award went to Lenovo’s Thinkpad X1 Fold, which — even though it’s on the expensive side and left us with a few questions — was the only foldable laptop with a confirmed shipping window and price tag. Most of the other laptops at this year’s CES were pretty boring, however, with little more than incremental updates on display. But there may be hope for the future with 5G modems and new screen technologies on the horizon. We doled out awards for the most triumphant CES comeback (Lora DiCarlo), the most overhyped thing at this year’s show (Samsung’s Neon digital avatars), and the most concept (Sony’s Vision-S) as well. Of course, the best non-CES news that everyone at the show was talking about was Sonos’ lawsuit against Google, in which, it accuses the tech giant of patent infringement. You can find the full list of the best of CES 2020 here. 176 Total Updates Since Dec 19, 2019, 2:56am EST Follow this stream January 5 TP-Link’s new mesh routers support Wi-Fi 6 By Dan Seifert@dcseifert Faster speeds and more device connections 3 comments / new January 5 Acer’s ConceptD 7 Ezel is a smaller transforming laptop designed for creators By Jon Porter@JonPorty Fold the screen down for drawing, or just make it float 3 comments / new January 5 Here’s Lenovo’s first eGPU enclosure and a ‘gaming laptop’ to go with it By Jon Porter@JonPorty The Lenovo BoostStation and Legion Y740S will arrive in May 17 comments / new January 5 This thermometer is smart enough to automatically adjust a Whirlpool oven’s temperature By Aliya Chaudhry It also sends real-time updates to your phone January 5 Vizio’s 2020 lineup includes its biggest TV yet and first-ever OLED By Chris Welch@chriswelch 43 comments / new January 5 Vizio’s new soundbar rotates its speakers for better Dolby Atmos surround sound By Chris Welch@chriswelch The Elevate’s side speakers point upward for Atmos content and forward for everything else 21 comments / new January 5 Samsung details its stunning bezel-less 8K TV By Chris Welch@chriswelch 99 percent of the front is all display 58 comments / new January 5 Samsung’s ‘artificial human’ project definitely looks like a digital avatar By James Vincent It’s realistic, but can it walk and talk like a human? 20 comments / new January 3 This wireless power startup says it can charge your phone using only radio waves By Nick Statt@nickstatt Guru is promising a bold future without wires 22 comments / new January 3 Samsung announces the Galaxy S10 Lite and Note 10 Lite By Chaim Gartenberg@cgartenberg They’re budget versions of the company’s popular flagships 51 comments / new January 3 Segway’s newest self-balancing vehicle is an egg-shaped wheelchair By Sean O'Kane@sokane1 The S-Pod has a top speed of 24 miles per hour 63 comments / new January 3 Samsung’s Odyssey G9 curved gaming monitor is a 49-inch QLED monster By Chaim Gartenberg@cgartenberg 5120x1440 resolution, 240Hz refresh rate, 1ms response time, and both FreeSync 2 and G-Sync compatibility 34 comments / new January 3 Segway-Ninebot unveils an electric kick scooter with cruise control By Sean O'Kane@sokane1 It’s foldable, too 5 comments / new January 3 Kohler puts an Alexa-enabled smart speaker in a showerhead By James Vincent ‘Alexa, play garble warble worble’ 46 comments / new January 3 OnePlus’ Concept One smartphone has a ‘disappearing’ camera By James Vincent Variable tinted glass hides the cameras on OnePlus’ concept device 19 comments / new January 3 LG unveils eight ‘Real 8K’ OLED and LCD TVs ahead of CES By Jon Porter@JonPorty Featuring Alexa, Google Assistant, HomeKit, and AirPlay 2 37 comments / new January 2 Join Vergecast Live at CES 2020 By Sarah Bishop Woods Nilay Patel, Dieter Bohn, and Ashley Carman are headed to Vegas January 2 Samsung and LG go head to head with AI-powered fridges that recognize food By Dami Lee@dami_lee Only one makes spherical ice though 18 comments / new January 2 Dell’s latest XPS 13 has a new design with a bigger display and Ice Lake chips By Chaim Gartenberg@cgartenberg Photography by Becca Farsace Dell has shaved off the bottom bezel for the best-looking XPS yet 65 comments / new January 2 GE’s new smart switches and dimmers can be installed in almost any home By Dan Seifert@dcseifert No neutral wire and no hub required 136 comments / new January 2 Samsung’s Galaxy Book Flex Alpha aims to be a cheaper QLED 2-in-1 laptop By Chaim Gartenberg@cgartenberg A cheaper, less premium Galaxy Book Flex 15 comments / new January 2 LG’s latest rollable TV descends from the ceiling like a projector screen By Jon Porter@JonPorty LG Display is also introducing a 48-inch OLED panel for the first time 12 comments / new December 31, 2019 The automatic trash can is here By Thomas Ricker@Trixxy Townew ties off the bag when full and pulls a new bag into place 83 comments / new December 27, 2019 LG now makes a home gardening appliance By Thomas Ricker@Trixxy Hello, fresh 11 comments / new December 26, 2019 Teslasuit’s new VR gloves let you feel virtual objects and track your pulse By Adi Robertson@thedextriarchy Some new gloves for your full-body VR suit 7 comments / new Pagination Prev 176 results : Page 7 of 8 Next Chorus Terms of Use Privacy Notice Cookie Policy Do not sell my info Communications Preferences Licensing FAQ Accessibility Platform Status Contact Tip Us Community Guidelines About Ethics Statement Vox Media Vox Media Vox Media logo.
