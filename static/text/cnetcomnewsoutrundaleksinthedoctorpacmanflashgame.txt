No word on any Ms. Pac-Man companions. Bonnie Burton March 5, 2014 10:20 AM PST Screenshot by Leslie Katz/CNET Play a Time Lord version of Pac-Man complete with a pixilated bow tie in this fan-made Flash game Doctor Pacman -- made by Ruben P. Vargas from Rarity Workshop. Ghosts Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Clyde (renamed Caan, Thay, Jast, and Seec) are replaced with their corresponding colored daleks. As Doctor Pacman, you must gobble the sonic screwdriver to disable the daleks and make them vulnerable to attack. When the daleks are in attack mode again, they chant "exterminate" over and over as they chase your Time Lord, who runs around the Tardis, just like in "Doctor Who." The game isn't fancy, but it does use Pac-Man sound effects as well as a nifty 8-bit "Doctor Who" theme song. Play the game and see if you can outrun the daleks before it's too late. Once you've mastered Doctor Pacman, try another fan-made "Doctor Who" game, Dalek Invaders.
