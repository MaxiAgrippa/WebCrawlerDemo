HP had said it was waiting for the update before it released its first product using the software. Ina Fried September 24, 2007 5:34 PM PDT Microsoft said Monday that it has finished a planned update to its Windows Home Server software, paving the way for Hewlett-Packard to finish its product based on the new operating system. HP, which had expected to be one of the first to offer a home server based on Microsoft's software, earlier said that it would wait for this update before releasing its MediaSmart Server. The changes are designed to improve the products "usability and out-of box experience," Microsoft said. The software update is also being made available to other Windows Home Server customers via Windows Update. More details on the software are available on Microsoft's Windows Home Server blog.
