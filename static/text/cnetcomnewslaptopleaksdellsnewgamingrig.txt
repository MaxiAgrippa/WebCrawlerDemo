Dan Ackerman August 6, 2007 5:36 PM PDT Imagine our surprise when we were surfing around the Web this weekend and found some alleged top-secret leaked info about a new upcoming 17-inch gaming laptop from Dell, reportedly called the XPS m1730. Of course, after all the previous leaks about Dell's 13-inch m1330 and the rest of Dell's current laptop lineup, you'd think the company would pretty much expect this kind of thing. In any event, our favorite French tech Web site, LesDeLLiens.com, reports that the XPS m1730 will be released (at least in France) on August 27, and it supposedly will offer Intel's new Core 2 Extreme X7800 CPU, a Blu-ray drive, SLI graphics, and even a separate number pad (something the current model, the XPS m1710, lacks). The same basic info is also reported on another site known for leaked laptop info, NotebookItalia.it. Is this the Dell XPS m1730? Of course, getting your tech scoops through roughly translated French and Italian Web sites is a notoriously sketchy business at best, so we'll just have to wait and see if this new model pops up on Dell's site around the end of the month.
