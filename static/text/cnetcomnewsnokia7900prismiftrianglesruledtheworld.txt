Better yet, love triangular keys? Have we got the phone for you! Behold the triangulastic Nokia 7900 Prism Andrew Lim January 21, 2008 5:56 AM PST Variety, according to people wiser than us, is the spice of life -- and Nokia's 7900 Prism is exactly 80 per cent spicier than the next mobile phone. Made up of triangular patterns and a sturdy but thin body, the Prism is one of the strangest-looking phones we've seen yet. One of the most bizarre features is its collection of entirely triangular keys. We have to admit that our first impressions of the keypad aren't very good. It's just not very usable -- the keys are too fiddly for our liking. Look past the keypad and you find a solid phone in terms of design and features -- it has 3G, a 2-megapixel camera and an OLED display. But it's the Prism's thinness that impresses most -- and left us wishing this phone had a better keypad. The Nokia 7900 Prism is available to buy SIM-free for around £300 or free on a monthly contract with O2. Look out for a proper vindaloo of a review shortly. Update: A full review of the Prism is now available on the site. -Andrew Lim Comments Phones Notification on Notification off Mobile Close Discuss: Nokia 7900 Prism: If triangles ruled the world Sign in to comment Be respectful, keep it civil and stay on topic.
