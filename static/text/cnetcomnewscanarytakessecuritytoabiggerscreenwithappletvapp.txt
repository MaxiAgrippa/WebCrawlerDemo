Canary customers can now tune in on Apple TV. Megan Wollerton November 29, 2016 9:00 AM PST Now playing: Watch this: Canary's indoor/outdoor camera sings a new tune 1:14 Startup Canary, maker of the $199/£159 Canary Flex and the $199/£159 Canary Smart Home Security device, has today released an app update for both Android and iPhone customers. This next-gen software is supposed to make it possible for Canary owners to view their camera's live feed via Apple TV. You should be able to check out your activity timeline from Apple TV as well. Nest announced a similar update earlier in November, but the Google/Alphabet property extended TV viewing to both Android TV and Apple TV users. I asked Canary about this and the company said it didn't currently have plans for an Android TV integration.

Canary In addition to Apple TV connectivity, the Canary app should now work on Android tablets and iPads -- previously, the app was limited to phones. And, it should work with Android Wear products, including the Moto 360 ($200 at Amazon), LG Watch, Huawei Watch ($135 at Amazon) and Asus ZenWatch. Canary software now also supports an on-demand siren-triggering emergency button for anyone with a siren-equipped Canary Smart Home Security device ($169 at Walmart). Canary Flex ($130 at Walmart) models do not come with built-in sirens. We've already reviewed Canary's Smart Home Security product, but we expect to get our hands on a Flex in short order, so we'll be sure to test out these software updates when that happens. 53 indoor security cameras for a safer smart home 54 Photos CNET Smart Home See All • reading Canary takes security to a bigger screen with Apple TV app • Mar 27 How to keep your bread fresh for longer • Mar 27 The best Wi-Fi extender for almost everybody • Mar 27 The best coffee grinder you can buy right now • Mar 26 9 online cooking classes to keep you full and fulfilled Comments CNET Smart Home Security Notification on Notification off Smart Home Close Discuss: Canary takes security to a bigger screen with Apple TV app Sign in to comment Be respectful, keep it civil and stay on topic.
