Learn how to create a more comprehensive security approach by examining the different approaches of password vaults and privilege management during this webinar. Well another Independence Day has come and gone here in the land of stars and stripes, causing at least some in the tech blogosphere to turn their thoughts toward freedom. "Digital independence day: Your guide to DIY, open-source, anonymous free computing" was the offering over at PCWorld, for example. "It's Time for IT Pros to Declare Their Technology Freedom" was the thought du jour at CIO. Unfortunately, for those of us here in the Linux blogosphere -- where freedom has always been part of the plan -- other headlines have had, shall we say, a moderating effect on all that enthusiasm. 'NSA Classifies You as Extremist' "Use Tor? Read the Tails website? You're on the NSA's 'EXTREMIST' list" read one, for example -- mentioning respected publication Linux Journal, no less. "NSA is now targeting people for bulking up their web security" read another. "Value Online Privacy? NSA Classifies You as an 'Extremist,' Collects More Than Metadata" read another. Perhaps using Linux -- or reading LinuxInsider, for that matter -- should be considered an extreme sport from now on, Linux Girl humbly suggests. '7 Improvements the Linux Desktop Needs' Well, at least we're still free to put Linux on our desktops -- though even that subject has been a contentious one lately. "7 Improvements the Linux Desktop Needs" is the title of the article over at Datamation. Down at the blogosphere's Punchy Penguin Saloon, it stirred up quite a froth. "The seven improvements are interesting, but at this point in the development of Linux, hardly required," Linux Rants blogger Mike Stone told Linux Girl over a fresh Freedom Foo Frappe, for example. "I would consider them 'nice-to-haves.'" 'The Push We've Been Waiting for' Right now, "Linux only really needs that one big thing to push it into popular usage," Stone added. "Windows maintains its dominance because of laziness, really -- Windows is what comes on the computer, and for most people, it's not bad enough to change for something else." Corporations, meanwhile, "are years behind where the actual industry is," he said. "My own only migrated to Windows 7 last year." In short, "the Linux desktop doesn't really need the stuff that most people seem to think it needs," Stone concluded. "What it needs is a push, and Windows 8 along with SteamOS could very well be the push we've been waiting for." 'Gather and Find Some Standards' Most of the requirements listed in the Datamation article are already met, Google+ blogger Gonzalo Velasco C. opined. "We have friendly distros -- not only for system administrators or geeks -- easy application centers and update managers." What would help Linux spread is for the developers of distros and desktop environments to "gather and find some standards," he suggested -- "always keeping the flexibility to change everything, as usual in GNU/Linux and not in other OSes." At the same time, "we need more critical mass and OEM support," he added. "How about: Take a break from adding new features and make sure all apps use the existing features as well as modern APIs?" consultant and Slashdot blogger Gerhard Mack suggested. 'I Keep Several Machines Around' "For me, anything I want to do in a desktop can be done in one or another Linux desktop," Google+ blogger Kevin O'Brien agreed. "Where I can perhaps quibble is when one desktop does most of what I need, but is missing something I really like from another," he added. "For example, in general I love KDE, but for many things involving audio, I have to switch to a different desktop. "I like Unity as an alternative, but I really miss the panels and widgets I am used to on KDE," O'Brien said. "So I keep several machines around, with different desktops, and use the one best suited to my needs at any given time." 'Some Seem Like Decent Ideas' Compiz "already provides 'viewport' previews, which permits antialiased previews of virtual desktops," noted Hyperlogos blogger Martin Espinoza, reacting to one of the items on Datamation's list. "I used to use avant-window-navigator and compiz for a sort of like-OSX-but-better interface, with emerald for the eye candy," he said, noting that Emerald is now out of date. "I find the existing menu system to work fine, but people having trouble navigating can use a tool like gnome-do," Espinoza suggested. 'This is the same method of navigation every other major desktop operating system has adopted to make it simpler to find what you are looking for." As for the other items on Datamation's list, "some seem like decent ideas, but I have to wonder if they're not actually solved problems as well," he concluded. 'That Is in the Pipe' "All of the latest and greatest features of graphical desktops are available to users of GNU/Linux," blogger Robert Pogson told Linux Girl. "I have a virtual workspace switcher in Xfce 4 that does show me a thumbnail of the desktop as it is. I can run multiple copies of applications with different themes by setting up virtual machines and using the amazingly versatile X window system to display an application from one virtual machine on the desktop of another real or virtual machine. "I can set up bibliographic databases for documents using LibreOffice -- it is a suite, and one can have a database in one window and any document in another," Pogson added. "I can copy and paste to my heart's content. I have templates as well as styles in LibreOffice." The only thing lacking for Pogson in LibreOffice are chart styles, and "that is in the pipe," he said. "Meanwhile, templates in Gnumeric are great for spreadsheets with charts." Bottom line: "The grumbling that GNU/Linux is not ready for the desktop is made by people who don't know how to use the incredible versatility of GNU/Linux," Pogson asserted. "OEMs and others should invest the time to learn how to use the capabilities. Ordinary users should not have to figure this stuff out." OEMs and retailers should also "be putting this stuff on retail shelves," he added. "What's holding them back is the dying carcass of Wintel that held all of IT back for more than a decade trying to shoehorn every user into the 'one true way' of doing IT at great expense." 'Demand Better' Last but not least, SoylentNews blogger hairyfeet countered the Datamation article with seven suggestions of his own: 1. "A 'help me!' button: Too much assuming a user has skills to do tasks that are beyond them equals fail." 2. "GET RID OF CLI!!! You use it as a crutch -- learn to make REAL GUI (not screen scraping Bash) and then have the OPTION of using CLI. If ANY answer has only Bash as the solution? You are a failure, please go away." 3. "System Restore: Windows has had it for 14 bloody years now -- the user should NOT have to make backups of the system in case your patch smells or something goes wrong." 4. "Rollback drivers: Again, it's been 14 years and Linux is lacking features Win2K had. Really? that's just sad." 5. "Quit with the dependency crap: It ain't 1993, space isn't that big an issue anymore, just stop. I don't care WHERE you put it, just fix it so if two programs need different versions of the same files you don't get a mess." 6. "Ditto with packing some 'little' program because you are calling on 13GB worth of dependencies. Either pack your program so it can run by itself or please go away -- it's just too much like java applet mess." 7. "A real, functional driver subsystem: You don't want an ABI? Fine, dazzle me, show me how you can get a functional driver subsystem without one, because that duct-taped mess you have now? It's a joke. If drivers work on first install they should work for the life of that hardware AND the life of that distro. You'd laugh your behind off if Win 8 SP1 wiped out something as fundamental as Realtek sound or a major graphics chip, right? So why put up with it from your distro? DEMAND BETTER."

Re: 'Extreme' Computing and Other Linux-World Problems jpollard Posted 2014-07-07 Most of that "Demand Better" is crap. #1 is good. No issues with a help button. #2 is already done. The problem is that there are a LOT of things that a CLI always does better, and more efficiently than a GUI... And some things CAN'T be done with a GUI. #3 System restore is necessary for Windows due to the weakness of the system. Actual backups are much better. #4 Most system keep the entire kernel around for three versions (or as many as the admin wants). And that allows for a "rollback" of a lot more than just drivers. #5 "dependency crap" is there to optimize download efficiency. Why download 10 GB of libraries when you already have it? #6 is a renamed #5. Having separate libraries allows for modular ... Read More Reply PROVE IT! hairyfeet Posted 2014-07-27 Take the Hairyfeet Challenge and post it to YouTube. the challenge has been posted here enough times so it should be easy to find. I can pass the challenge with Win2K (from RTM to EOL without a single driver fail) XP (ditto) and the same goes for Vista/7/8 to current. The challenge has lasted for 7+ years now with NO DISTRO able to pass, NONE. The closest was a poor sad individual that had to use a copy of Scientific linux (which states on its home page its NOT FOR HOME OR BUSINESS but for research labs) and even then he STILL couldn't keep functional drivers for wireless and sound LOL! You know what the definition of insanity is? Its failing for 20+ years and then blaming everyone else. You'd laugh if Windows went back to using VXDs and .INI files right, well guess what? Those are ... Read More Reply Re: PROVE IT! jpollard Posted 2014-07-27 Don't have to prove it. I have used Linux on the desktop ever since about 1995. worked better than SunOS, which worked MUCH better than any Windows based desktop. Never had a virus. Never needed to "restore to a checkpoint". MUCH better security design. Reply Re: PROVE IT! hairyfeet Posted 2014-07-27 Anecdotes and bullshit, quit wasting my time. My copy of Windows 7 has never failed and never had a bug therefor Windows 7 is completely bug and error free! See why your anecdotes are worthless? Either put up or shut up, the challenge is 100% free, takes less than 4 hours start to finish, and is easily replicated. You won't though because IT WILL FAIL and I know this as I've personally done the challenge with the top 5 distros and ALL FAILED. So don't waste my time with lame anecdotes, show your prove or don't waste everyone's time with BS. Reply Re: PROVE IT! jpollard Posted 2014-07-27 I can trivially make tests that all windows distributions fail as well. They failed the supercomputer market after all. They failed the financial stock markets as well. They have failed the phone markets too. They have failed reliability tests as shown by NASA and the DoD. Biggest joke of all was that "Windows for Warships" garbage - that resulted in ships having to be towed back to port. Windows. Not fit for any purpose. Reply Re: PROVE IT! hairyfeet Posted 2014-07-27 Anecdotes and bullshit along with an attempt to move the goalposts, quit wasting my time. All you are doing is showing that Linux isn't suitable for purpose because if it was? you'd do the challenge to prove me wrong. But you can't because the driver model is a broken pile of garbage and the OS isn't even a match for Windows XP. Either put up or shut up, with every post where you try to dodge all you do is point out Linux is a failure. Reply Re: PROVE IT! jpollard Posted 2014-07-28 Not all Windows drivers work either. MS DOES change the API, and drivers that are not updated are then broken. Not changing the API means the kernel has to be limited in its usefulness. It also means the kernel cannot evolve very fast as each change breaks all the previous drivers. And that is true for all kernels. Linux has chosen the path of faster evolution. That choice is also reflected in the number of places that Linux is usable where Windows is not. The fact that you can't accept that is your problem. Reply Re: PROVE IT! hairyfeet Posted 2014-07-29 You are trying to move the goalpost AND change the subject, sure signs of fear. If you are confident in Linux PROVE IT or stop hiding behind bullshit and anecdotes! The challenge is simple, verifiable, and only simulates HALF, I repeat HALF of the Windows lifecycle. If you think I'm wrong PROVE IT or stop hiding your fear of the truth with BS and changes of subject. So you won't even have to bother using the search button here is the challenge.. Take ANY mainstream (not LTS, because even Ubuntu advises against mainstream users using LTS) from FIVE years ago, this simulates a 5 year typical lifecycle. This BTW is less than HALF a windows support cycle, so I'm cutting linux a break. Lets say you use Ubuntu, that would be Ubuntu 9.10 and can be downloaded from their archive. Install it on ANY PC, ... Read More Reply Re: PROVE IT! jpollard Posted 2014-07-29 Then you should look at RH. Even the installation is GUI. Even Fedora passes such a stupid test. Here is one for Fedora 20: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNcTYKls-Zc Reply Re: PROVE IT! hairyfeet Posted 2014-07-30 Red Hat is a MINIMUM of $300 a year for a support contract... YOU FAIL SIR. And if providing even HALF of a Windows OS functionality is "stupid" and something YOUR OS CAN'T DO then I'm sorry but its a hobbyist OS, right up there with Haiku and Minix...is that what you are claiming now? Put up or admit your OS isn't fit for purpose, your choice. The entire challenge is free, takes less than 4 hours, can be done on any PC you have lying around or you can always add a partition to your current junker. Put up or admit failure, your choice. Reply Re: PROVE IT! jpollard Posted 2014-07-30 Didn't think you would accept anything. And RH is only 300 if you want 24x7 support and that was not a MAXIMUM. Support goes from $49 on up. And you can't get that from MS. It is stupid when you have to pay about $25,000 (and higher) to get support for databases, office suites, languages and development systems, web services... I seem to remember $12,000 was just for a database system with support. And now just web support is $12,000 alone, and $3,800 to renew, per year. AND have to pay for anti-virus protection, reinstallations, bricking, constant reboots (though that seems to be FINALLY getting better), disk defragmentation (again, FINALLY getting almost as good as when UNIX/Linux has had for the last 20 years), poor security design... Read More Reply Re: PROVE IT! hairyfeet Posted 2014-07-30 So the ONLY way you SAY you can pass is by paying over $500 for the 10 years? How much is Windows again?....$89 on Newegg...yeah thanks for playing. Again lets see this proof, otherwise you are just slinging BS and anecdotes. My Windows has never gotten an infection and never crashed so Windows never gets infections or crashes...isn't anecdotes great? The challenge is there, time to put up or shut up. Why are you so scared? why is such a simple challenge, half of what Windows gives every person who buys it, frighten you? Afraid it will prove to you that you are dealing with a broken OS? DEMAND BETTER. Reply Re: PROVE IT! jpollard Posted 2014-08-24 No. And as I said, I don't expect you to accept the proof. And not scared. Just don't like all the vulnerabilities, and illegal activity MS does. I already know Windows is broken - the proof is in every catastrophic failure in security. I did demand better. That is why I use Linux. Reply Re: 'Extreme' Computing and Other Linux-World Problems LineVoltage Posted 2014-07-09 Let me critique your responce. 1. Good to see that people agree that this is needed. 2. There are TWO and ONLY TWO things that CLI does better than a full GUI. Repetitive tasks and scripting. With everything else CLI will get curb-stomped by a full GUI. Consumers do not want and will not tolerate having to use CLI. 3. You've completely dodged the question. Windows has system restore because it's a GOOD IDEA. Are you saying that having an "undo" function in word processors is also a bad idea and users should make backup copies of their documents every 5 minutes? If it is a good idea in a word processor, why is it a bad idea in an OS? 4. That's not the question. Where is the button that a user clicks on when the system updates their system and it ... Read More Reply Re: 'Extreme' Computing and Other Linux-World Problems jpollard Posted 2014-07-27 #2 - A CLI is better at anything a GUI has not already been programmed to do... And that doesn't mean just "Repetitive tasks and scripting". #3 - "Windows has system restore" which is only useful as a backup... Unfortunately it also screws up your system when you have had to add a lot of patches. Then you have to redo a lot of work. It also doesn't help if your disk goes south... The only solution is a real backup... A "system restore" should be part of the filesystem, support, not a separate feature. It is then just a "filesystem checkpoint", which also saves a lot of disk space... #4 - doesn't need one. See "filesystem checkpoint". #5 - What "dependency hell"? That is a term defined by ... Read More Reply Re: 'Extreme' Computing and Other Linux-World Problems hairyfeet Posted 2014-08-23 I can easily show you with basic math how "let the kernel devs handle drivers" is like "many eyes" a complete and total myth, ready? You have right now around 250,000 drivers out there for Linux, new hardware probably adds 3k-4k a month and you have MAYBE 500 kernel devs worldwide who have the years of experience in low level coding required to debug a low level driver...starting to see the flaw here? if you pumped the kernel devs full of speed so they did NOTHING but work on drivers 24/7 (and in reality the amount of time they spend on drivers versus the kernel is pretty low, probably 25% at best) then in a perfect scenario you'd have the drivers for a particular piece of hardware looked at by a kernel dev about once every 10 years for a max of 3 minutes! and this isn't ... Read More Reply Re: 'Extreme' Computing and Other Linux-World Problems jpollard Posted 2014-08-24 500 kernel developers? you must be joking. The last number I've read of was over 10,000. Yes, 50 or so top kernel developers. But they are backed by many projects developing and maintaining drivers. And each project may have a thousand or more developers contributing. Then there are the mailing lists for major subsystems, with thousands subscribers, the kernel janitors that carry out cleanup operations, those that are just learning, and then there are the vendors that also contribute. http://www.zdnet.com/who-writes-linux-almost-10000-developers-7000020717/ Then there is the fact that a single driver can handle entire families of devices - 15-30 devices from different vendors may be handled by a single driver. The shared development reduces the cost for all...
