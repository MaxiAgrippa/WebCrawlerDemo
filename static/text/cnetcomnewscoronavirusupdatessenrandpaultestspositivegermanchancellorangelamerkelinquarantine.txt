"This was a tough call to make -- F8 is an incredibly important event for Facebook and it's one of our favorite ways to celebrate all of you from around the world -- but we need to prioritize the health and safety of our developer partners, employees and everyone who helps put F8 on," Konstantinos Papamiltiadis, Facebook's director of developer platforms and programs, said in a statement. Instead of F8, Facebook said it's planning to bring developers together through locally hosted events, videos and livestreamed content. Feb. 26: In a press conference, President Trump said the risk to Americans remains low. "The No. 1 priority from our standpoint is the health and safety of the American people," he said. He noted that of the original 15 US cases, one remained in hospital and was "pretty sick," with 14 others either fully recovered or in recovery. He also announced that Vice President Pence would coordinate the response to the virus. The CDC confirmed local transmission of the virus had occurred in the US. This means the virus was able to spread from person-to-person in the US, rather than being imported by a traveler. Feb. 25: A top Olympics official suggested the 2020 Tokyo Olympic games, scheduled to begin July 24, could be canceled, with a decision to be made by the end of May. Feb. 23: A number of high-profile events were canceled in Italy, including Serie A football matches and one of the world's biggest fashion shows in Milan. The Venice Carnival, a world-famous masquerade, was also cut short. Tens of thousands of Italians were put into lockdown after a third death was recorded in the country. Feb. 21: Italy reported the first person-to-person transmission of the virus and the total number of COVID-19 infections had risen to six. The cases were clustered in Italy's Lombardy region, in the north. A day later, Feb. 22, Italy reported its first two deaths. Feb. 20: South Korea reported its first death from the coronavirus. Feb. 19: Iran's first confirmed cases of COVID-19 were reported and, on the same day, its first two deaths. One of the biggest video game conferences, PAX East, which takes place in Boston, saw a few cancellations. Sony, which manufactures the PlayStation and was scheduled to show off the highly anticipated title The Last of Us Part II, decided not to attend because of coronavirus concerns. In a breakthrough, researchers working with the coronavirus created the first 3D map of a special protein that allows the coronavirus to get into human cells. Using state-of-the-art microscopy, the team at the University of Texas at Austin showed the virus is able to bind to human cells stronger than the SARS coronavirus but also noted the spike proteins can be targeted in the creation of a vaccine or treatment. A vaccine, however, is still at least 18 months away. Feb. 17: Apple announced that the coronavirus outbreak would likely hurt its first-quarter revenue as factories were shuttered and fewer Chinese customers were purchasing iPhones. "Work is starting to resume around the country, but we are experiencing a slower return to normal conditions than we had anticipated," Apple said in a statement. "As a result, we do not expect to meet the revenue guidance we provided for the March quarter." Shigeru Omi, the chief director of the Japan Community Health Care Organization, suggested the Olympics could be disrupted or even canceled, depending on how the virus continues to spread and evolve over the next few months. "Whether the virus is under control by the time of the Olympics is anyone's guess," he said. Feb. 14: The US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases released new images of the virus for the first time. NIAID's Rocky Mountain Laboratories in Montana used specialized equipment, scanning and transmission electron microscopes, to capture the digitally colorized close-ups. Feb. 12: Mobile World Congress, the world's largest trade show for the mobile industry, was canceled by the show's organizer, the GSMA. The cancellation came after numerous big names including LG, Nvidia, Nokia, Vodafone, Amazon and Facebook announced they would be pulling out. Chinese health authorities reported a jump in the number of cases and deaths in Hubei, the epicenter of the outbreak. Over 13,300 new cases were recorded in Hubei alone, an increase of 700% over the previous day. Chinese authorities had adopted a new clinical method for confirming cases, which saw them add "clinically diagnosed cases" to the count, potentially helping patients receive treatment sooner, according to CNN. Feb. 11: The WHO officially named the disease caused by the novel coronavirus "COVID-19" (for coronavirus disease 2019.) That made things a little confusing, because the virus itself is not named COVID-19, but SARS-CoV-2. Feb. 9: The outbreak reached a grim milestone: 811 deaths -- more than the 2002-2003 SARS epidemic, which killed around 800 people. Feb. 8: The first US citizen died from COVID-19 in Wuhan. Feb. 7: Li Wenliang, the Chinese doctor who originally sounded the alarm about a spate of mysterious SARS-like illnesses in his WeChat group, died. He was 34. Feb. 4: The Diamond Princess returned to port but Japanese health authorities were invited onboard to check the crew for signs of the coronavirus. It had 2,666 guests and 1,045 crew on board. Feb. 2: The first death outside China was reported in the Philippines. A 44-year-old man from Wuhan with preexisting health conditions developed severe pneumonia and died at a hospital in Manila. Feb. 1: A passenger who stayed aboard the Diamond Princess cruise from Yokohama, Japan, and disembarked in Hong Kong was confirmed to have the coronavirus. The ship was scheduled to return to port Feb. 4. Jan. 30: The WHO declared a public health emergency of international concern. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director general of the WHO, said the organization was working with national and international public health partners to get the outbreak under control. It also issued recommendations to prevent the spread of the virus and ensure a "measured and evidence-based response." Jan. 28: 100 deaths were recorded in China, with most of them coming from Hubei province, the epicenter of the outbreak. Jan. 24: Major attractions began closing down, including Disney Parks in Shanghai and Hong Kong. Jan. 23: China began to lock down cities including Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak. Public transport was suspended, as were flights and trains out of the city. The travel restrictions were extended to four other cities (Huanggang, Ezhou, Chibi and Zhijiang) later that day, and constraints were announced in eight more cities on Jan. 24. Beijing canceled Lunar New Year plans, which were to begin Jan. 25. Jan. 20: The first human-to-human transmission was reported by a Chinese expert on infectious diseases after two individuals caught the disease from family members and 14 health workers were infected by patients. This was a significant development in the spread of the virus and suggested cases could be much higher. Jan. 16: Japan saw its first case of the virus, a man who had traveled to Wuhan. Jan. 13: The first case outside China was reported by the WHO. A woman who had traveled from Wuhan to Thailand tested positive for the novel coronavirus. Jan. 11: The first death was reported. A 61-year-old male with an underlying health condition who had visited the seafood market died from heart failure on Jan. 9. Jan. 10: The genetic sequence of the isolated coronavirus was shared for the first time. In total, four sequences of the virus were shared by various Chinese research institutes. A team investigating the virus eventually published their research in the New England Journal of Medicine on Jan. 24. Jan. 7: A novel coronavirus was identified from patients and given a placeholder name: 2019-nCoV. Jan. 1: China shut down the Huanan Wholesale Seafood Market in Wuhan, which was linked to a number of patients with the disease. 2019 Dec. 31: China alerted the WHO of a spate of illnesses in Wuhan, China. The central city lies some 650 miles south of Beijing and is home to more than 11 million people. Dec. 30: Dr. Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, warned colleagues from his medical school via WeChat about a cluster of patients being treated for viral pneumonia, linking it to the SARS coronavirus. Investigations would later rule out that virus, which had caused an outbreak in 2002-2003. Wenliang was reprimanded by Chinese authorities for speaking out about the mysterious illnesses he had seen at his hospital and was forced to sign a statement saying he was spreading rumors. Dec. 1: The first patient experienced symptoms of the mysterious pneumonia-like illness now known as COVID-19. No epidemiological link was established between this case and later instances of the disease. The disease may have made its way into humans even earlier, with Chinese media reporting the first case presented on November 17.
