The new Deco Mesh Wi-Fi 6 systems come in three different speed tiers, with prices ranging from $189.99 to $449.99. They will be available starting in March 2020. Wi-Fi 6 support brings a host of technologies and new acronyms to the table, but the most applicable one is that it allows for more simultaneously connected devices than Wi-Fi 5. TP-Link’s new routers also support the latest WPA 3 security standards. The top of the range is the $449.99 Deco X90, which has a tri-band system and can cover up to 6,000 square feet. TP-Link says that its “dynamic backhaul” technology can utilize all three bands (one 2.4GHz band and two 5GHz bands) to connect the mesh units for better speed and stability, and it supports up to 200 device connections. The X90 comes in a two-pack and includes a 2.5 Gbps WAN port for high-speed internet connections up to 1 Gbps. Related Wi-Fi 6: is it really that much faster? Occupying the middle tier is the Deco X60 system, which is also available in a two-pack and will cost $269.99. It has a dual-band system, so it doesn’t have as much bandwidth as the X90 and only covers 5,000 square feet in total. The X20 is rated to support 150 device connections. Grid View Finally, the least-expensive model is the Deco X20, which will be available in a two- or three-pack for $189.99 or $269.99, respectively. The X20 is a dual-band system, with lower throughput than either the X60 or X90. All three systems include TP-Link’s Deco Mesh Technology for roaming between nodes, adaptive routing, and self-healing in cases of interference. They are set up and controlled through TP-Link’s iOS and Android apps as well as through voice controls via Amazon’s Alexa. Interestingly, the new systems don’t support the powerline backhaul option that’s available on TP-Link’s Wi-Fi 5-based Deco P9 system. Correction: The Deco X60 actually has dual-band system, not a tri-band system like we originally stated. We regret the error.
