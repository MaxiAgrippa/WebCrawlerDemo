If you didn’t preorder, you can get one from numerous retailers and carrier stores around the country. Below, you’ll find all of the carrier stores and retailers that are selling the phones. However, if you preordered one, it’s likely that you already received your phone. You can now redeem your free credit earned by ordering one before the March 6th cutoff date. Here’s how: Samsung is giving S20 buyers a $100 voucher to use at its online store. The S20 Plus will net you a $150 gift card, and the S20 Ultra comes with a $200 credit. Redeem your credit through the Shop Samsung app on iOS or Android by providing your proof of purchase. (Note: You’ll be eligible for this credit regardless of where you choose to buy a Samsung Galaxy S20 phone.) Related Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra review: shutter bug Photo by Nick Statt / The Verge Samsung Galaxy S20 The only configuration of the Galaxy S20 that Samsung offers in the US has 12GB of RAM and 128GB of internal storage (with 1TB of microSD storage). It costs $1,000. Samsung Galaxy S20 Starts at $1,000 unlocked $1,000 at Samsung Samsung Galaxy S20 (128GB) Starts at $1,000 unlocked $1,000 at B&H Photo Samsung Galaxy S20 (128GB) Includes Galaxy Buds and Duo wireless charging pad for free $1,000 at Amazon Verizon offers the S20 for $41.66 per month on its 24-month device payment plan. However, this device won’t be available on launch day. It actually won’t release at Verizon for a few months. (See below for details on the S20 Plus and S20 Ultra.) The reason for the delay is because the version of the S20 launching through other carriers works with “sub-6” 5G networks, which Verizon does not utilize for 5G. The version to be released later in the year will support its millimeter-wave 5G network. If it’s crucial that you have access to Verizon’s 5G network, the S20 Plus and S20 Ultra will both work with it on launch day, depending, of course, on the 5G coverage in your area. Last note: The Verge has received confirmation from Samsung that the unlocked Galaxy S20 will be compatible with Verizon at launch, though only for LTE service. T-Mobile offers the S20 for $41.67 per month for 24 months. It requires $0 down. AT&T offers the phone for $33.24 per month over 30 months. You can get an S20 for free (paid back in monthly credits over a 30-month period) if you sign up for an AT&T Unlimited Extra or Unlimited Elite plan, port over your number, and agree to a device payment plan. If you don’t port your number over, you can still get $500 off. Sprint offers the Galaxy S20 for $41.67 with its 18-month Sprint Flex lease, and it’s holding a few promotions that might save you some money. If you switch to Sprint and trade in your Galaxy S8 or newer Samsung phone, you’ll pay $0 per month for the 18-month lease of the phone. (Monthly credits of $41.67 begin after two months of service.) Secondly, if you lease an S20 at full price ($41.67 per month) as part of an upgrade or new line and agree to open another new line, you’ll get an S20 for free. To be clear, you’ll pay tax on the second phone, but monthly credits of $41.67 will start to appear after two billing cycles. Xfinity is taking $300 off the price of a Galaxy S20 if you switch to its service until April 5th. It also says that existing users can get a $300 prepaid gift card when they buy the S20. Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus Unlike the S20, Samsung’s Galaxy S20 Plus comes in two configurations: one with 128GB of storage and another with 512GB of storage (both support up to 1TB of microSD storage). Prices start at $1,199 for the 128GB model and work up to $1,299 for the step-up phone with 512GB of internal storage space. Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus (128GB) Starts at $1,200 unlocked $1,200 at Samsung Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus (128GB) Starts at $1,200 unlocked $1,200 at B&H Photo Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus (128GB) Includes Galaxy Buds and Duo wireless charging pad for free $1,200 at Amazon Verizon sells the S20 Plus for $49.99 per month on its 24-month payment plan. You can get some discounts by way of monthly credits, but it’s a little complicated. If you buy an S20 Plus, you can get $1,050 off another Galaxy S20 series phone (paid back with monthly credits) when you open a new line and sign up for a payment plan. This offer stacks with a $150 credit paid back to you over 24 months that you’ll get just for buying one of the phones. Alternatively, existing customers only can save up to $300 on the S20 Plus when they upgrade and trade in their old device. This trade-in offer stacks with the $150 credit mentioned above, but you won’t be eligible to get a free S20, as detailed near the top of this paragraph. T-Mobile carries the S20 Plus for $50 per month for 24 months. The 128GB version requires $0 down, and while the 512GB model costs the same amount each month, it requires $149 down. AT&T offers the phone at $40 per month for 30 months. You can get an S20 Plus for $200 (paid back in monthly credits over a 30-month period) if you trade in your old phone, sign up for an AT&T Unlimited Extra or Unlimited Elite plan, port over your number, and agree to a device payment plan. If you don’t port your number over, you can still get $500 off. There are a lot of steps, but it might be worth it for you. Sprint offers the Galaxy S20 for $50 with its 18-month Sprint Flex lease. If you switch to Sprint and trade in your Galaxy S8 or newer Samsung phone, you’ll pay $8.33 per month for the 18-month lease of the phone (monthly credits of $41.67 begin after two months of service). Secondly, if you lease an S20 Plus at full price ($50 per month) as part of an upgrade or new line and agree to open another new line, you’ll get an S20 for free. To be clear, you’ll pay tax on the second phone when you checkout, but monthly credits of $41.67 will start to appear after two billing cycles.

Photo by Dieter Bohn / The Verge Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra The new S20 Ultra is the high-end option in Samsung’s range of flagship phones this year. It’s more “Ultra” than the other S20 phones in a few ways. Check out our roundup that compares each and every spec of the new phones, but here are the highlights: it has a 6.9-inch display versus 6.7 inches on the S20 Plus. It also has a bigger 5,000mAh battery compared to the S20 Plus’ 4,500mAh battery and the S20’s 4,000mAh pack. The crucial differences come down to the optional 16GB of RAM upgrade and the 108MP wide-angle lens used in its four-lens array. This phone starts at $1,399, making it one of Samsung’s most expensive phones yet. Add more to that price if you want extra RAM or storage. Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra (128GB) Starts at $1,400 unlocked $1,400 at Samsung Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra (128GB) Starts at $1,400 unlocked $1,400 at B&H Photo Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra (128GB) Includes Galaxy Buds and Duo wireless charging pad for free $1,400 at Amazon Verizon offers the S20 Ultra at $58.33 per month for its 24-month payment plan.

AT&T sells the phone starting at $46.67 per month for 30 months.
