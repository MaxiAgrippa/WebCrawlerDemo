China's massively popular WeChat messaging app has exposed school students to prostitutes through its "People Nearby" feature, which is sometimes used by prostitutes as a form of, shall we say, mobile advertising.

CCTV journalists said they reported six of the scandalous accounts to Tencent, the maker of WeChat, but that the accounts remained active when the program ran.

Following the ISP block, some Twitter accounts have been shooting out links to alternative, thus-far-unblocked sites. The nation's telecommunications agency told Twitter that the company was enabling "a situation that is seriously damaging to the Venezuelan economy." Twitter had no immediate comment. The black market rate for dollars is more than nine times higher than the official rate.

The attempted acquisition, apparently announced for the first time at the recent TechCrunch/Technode event in Shanghai, was for less than US$100 million. Google pulled its search engine from China in 2010. Nowadays, Baidu holds a 60-plus percent share of the search market -- although competitors are lurking. [Source: TechCrunch] Alibaba Giving Away Smartphones Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba has launched an investment program that includes giving away smartphones. In an effort to shore up the mobile market, e-tailers are being courted with data analysis tools; guides on how to set up online stores for mobile devices; and, yes, a free smartphone for every subscriber running Alibaba's mobile operating system. So-called "m-commerce" is booming in China. For example, during the nation's annual online shopping orgy, held on November 11, about 21 percent of transactions were completed on mobile devices; in 2012, that number was just 5 percent.
