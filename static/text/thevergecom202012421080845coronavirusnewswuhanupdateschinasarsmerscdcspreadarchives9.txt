The World Health Organization declared a global public health emergency over the outbreak. Coronaviruses are common in many types of animals, and can sometimes jump to humans. In this case, the virus probably came from a bat. Two other coronaviruses have infected humans, causing outbreaks of SARS and MERS in 2002 and 2012, respectively. This time, scientists were able to quickly sequence the virus and develop a diagnostic test. The new coronavirus appears to cause symptoms like fever, cough, difficulty breathing, and other respiratory symptoms.
