The phone is on sale at Cricket Wireless starting Friday for $229.99 with qualifying service plans. It's available in a platinum gray color as well as an exclusive Blonde Rose, which appears to be a metallic shade of pink.

The Stylo 5 features a 6.2-inch display, a 3,500 mAh battery, a 13MP rear-facing camera and a 5MP front-facing camera. The phone's stylus has customizable settings for writing, drawing and coloring.
