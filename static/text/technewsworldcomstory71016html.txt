For those who follow the intricacies of the competitive world of Apple device jailbreaking, it's been a lively week. One team of hackers had the anticipated "greenpois0n" patch ready to release. Then, another experienced jailbreak provider beat them to the punch with "limera1n." Users of iOS 4.1 were once again free to install non-Apple-authorized software on their phones and other gadgets -- from 3GS to current models. Then, early Tuesday, the Chronic-Dev team, makers of the greenpois0n fix, which was originally scheduled for the numerically interesting date of 10/10/10, delivered its patch to the public. The team's rationale was that Apple is quick to identify and plug any holes in i-device operating software so that future upgrades do not allow the same jailbreaking method. It wanted to analyze the hardware-level exploit limera1n purports to use as a hole and see if it could keep the jailbreak viable for longer. Where Angels Fear to Tread Why all the posturing? Well, the limera1n patch was delivered by code jockey George Holt, known online as "geohot." Holt walked away from the jailbreaking business in July, in what appeared to be a huff. The world of hacking is competitive, after all, and current-day Apple device wranglers have all the public relations and positioning challenges of Apple-loving and Apple-hating zealots generations before them. However, they now also have blogs and Twitter to fuel the frenzy. If you, too, want to bypass the Apple-imposed restriction on what software you can use on your iPhone or other iOS product, you can find software, instructions, YouTube videos, and myriad pieces of advice on the online forums. If you want to go with the first code to the punch, start with the limera1n site. If you wish to go with the earlier announced, but slightly later released, greenpois0n, check out its site. Both require Windows, and the greenpois0n patch requires that the device be updated to iOS 4.1 before starting. If the instructions for either seem to have lots of warnings and admonitions to be sure to make a current backup of your iPhone and its contents, it's for good reason. Jailbreaking blogs and forums are rife with pleas from users who have tried to run the patches or tried to update their iPhone operating systems after jailbreaking them and ended up with devices doing funny things, or, worse, doing nothing at all. In fact, the prospect of having a "bricked" phone is one of the biggest reasons mainstream consumers likely won't flock to any jailbreak, no matter how easy it is to implement, Josh Martin, senior analyst with Strategy Analytics, told MacNewsWorld. "It's just not worth the hassle," he said. The Tether Carrot Some average Joe iPhone users are willing to tolerate the hassle in order to install one of the tethering apps available outside the iTunes store. The tethering apps allow earlier models of the iPhone to serve as a data modem when they previously could not. In the case of the iPhone 4, the tethering apps allow users to get hotspot functionality for their phones without incurring the US$20 per month fee that AT&T imposes for the service. For most users, though, even such desirable extra functionality may not be worth the risk. Smartphones are expensive, noted Carl Howe, director with the Yankee Group. In general, consumers are loath to do anything to violate their warranties, and Apple will not provide service for a jailbroken device, he told MacNewsWorld. Not many people will risk hundreds of dollars for the increased abilities provided by renegade apps. When it comes to free tethering, AT&T can't be far behind in plugging that particular hole, Strategy Analytics' Martin predicted. "This is clearly a violation of the terms of service," he noted of those who tether phones without paying the extra fee. While AT&T may not find a technological fix to shut down the phone or tethering itself, Martin speculated, it may just decide to begin canceling the accounts of consumers who are tethering using jailbroken phones.
