Eagle-eyed bloggers already managed to rain on the Santa Rosa parade in early May, and we've since seen leaked laptops from Sonyand Lenovo. The latest unplanned product announcement comes from Dell, where Engadget has managed to get their hands on some promo literature for the upcoming Dell XPS m1330, a new 13-inch laptop. Purported highlights include: 13.3-inch LED backlit screen 32GB SSD hard drive WWAN (Verizon, Sprint, or AT&T) 802.11n Wi-Fi HDMI output Slot-loading DVD drive The real highlight of the XPS m1330 is its small size, even for a 13-inch laptop. It weighs around 4 pounds and is super thin, going from 0.87 inch in the front to 1.33 inches in the rear. No pricing or availability info has been released (or leaked) yet, so stay tuned for more details on this impressive-looking system.
