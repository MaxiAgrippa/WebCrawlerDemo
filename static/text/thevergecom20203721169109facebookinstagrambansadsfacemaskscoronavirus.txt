Facebook has also restricted social visitors to its offices, and canceled its participation in a number of conferences as a result of the outbreak. EBay and Amazon also have modified their rules around coronavirus-related merchandise. In a notice to sellers Friday, eBay said it was banning all sales of face masks, hand sanitizer, and disinfectant wipes in an effort to stem price gouging. It already has removed more than 20,000 listings for making unverified claims related to coronavirus. Amazon has removed third-party listings that significantly raised prices of hand sanitizer and face masks.
