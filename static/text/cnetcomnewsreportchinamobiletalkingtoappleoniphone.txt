Reuben Lee November 13, 2007 6:32 AM PST Crave Asia As the iPhone is expected to debut in Asia only next year, China's largest cell phone carrier is reportedly in talks with Apple to bring the much-anticipated handset to the Mainland. During a session with reporters at the GSMA Mobile Asia Congress in Macau, China Mobile's chief executive revealed that the company is engaged in talks with Apple on the iPhone, according to BusinessWeek. However, he confirmed that the two parties have not come to any agreement as there are still revenue-sharing issues to resolve. The Apple iPhone first launched in the U.S. market earlier this year and was recently rolled out in Europe. So far, there's been no word on when exactly the device will debut in Asia come next year.
