Here's what you'll need to know. Jason Cipriani October 23, 2012 4:31 PM PDT Jason Cipriani/CNET iOS 6 has been out for just over a month and is already installed on more than 200 million iOS devices across the globe. With such a big user base in such a short amount of time, hopefully we will begin to see an increase in the amount of companies integrating Passbook into their product offerings. We have already discussed Valpak passes, Starbucks integration,adding random gift cards and even how to create passes for Passbook. All of which were equally useful. And now we can add 20 more big-box retailers to the list, as Coupons.com has rolled out Passbook support, as TechCrunch reported this morning. Just like the TechCrunch report states, the complete list of retailers is: Avenue, Barnes & Noble, Bon-Ton, Carter's, Champion, Gordmans, Harbor Freight Tools, Jo-Ann, Lane Bryant, Macy's, Michaels, Old Navy, OshKosh B'gosh, Petco, PetSmart, Shopko, Spirit Halloween, Sweet Tomatoes, Ulta Beauty, and Yankee Candle. Adding a coupon for any one of the retailers listed above is easy. First, you'll need to visit Coupons.com from your iPhone or iPod Touch (the iPad doesn't support Passbook, so you won't be able to add passes from there). Select the Passbook option.

Screenshot by Jason Cipriani/CNET Find a coupon you'd like to add, then tap on the Add to Passbook button. Make sure you tap on Add in the top-right corner to add it to your Passbook. Screenshot by Jason Cipriani/CNET Add the pass to Passbook by tapping on the Add button in the upper-right corner. The next time you visit a participating retailer, open up Passbook and show the cashier the coupon. He or she should scan the bar code and you'll get your discount. If for some reason there are bar code issues, there's a code available to be hand-entered. Note that there isn't any location information tied to a pass you add, so it won't alert you or automatically pull up once you get close to the store. But, a discount is a discount, and if you have to work a bit more for it by actually unlocking your device and opening Passbook, so be it.
