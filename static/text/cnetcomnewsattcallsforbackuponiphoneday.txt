Tom Krazit June 21, 2007 4:42 PM PDT Eight days before the iPhone arrives, AT&T is planning for extra security and a flood of customers next Friday. The company has hired 2,000 temporary workers to help keep things rolling on iPhone Day (previously known as June 29th), according to CNN. It doesn't sound like these folks will be pressed into explaining the intricacies of AT&T's monthly data plans or selling Bluetooth headsets, but instead they'll help make sure rabid iPhone fans don't bum-rush the doors in hopes of securing an iPhone. A report yesterday said AT&T plans to close its stores at 4:30 p.m. on iPhone Day, reopening at 6:00 p.m. to start selling a certain product. Check out this story from my colleague Anne Broache for more information on where you'll need to go to witness the madness next Friday.
