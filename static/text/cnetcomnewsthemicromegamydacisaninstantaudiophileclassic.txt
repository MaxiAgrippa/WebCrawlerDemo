Steve Guttenberg March 6, 2013 7:36 AM PST The Micromega MyDac Micromega Desktop digital-to-analog converters keep getting better and better, and the Micromega MyDac is a fine example of the breed. The 24-bit/192-kHz MyDac has three digital inputs: coaxial, optical, and USB, all selectable via the thumb wheel control on the front panel. The stereo RCA analog outputs can feed either your powered speakers or power amp. I was pleased to see the MyDac has a built-in power supply, so it doesn't use a wall wart. Micromega will soon release a matching headphone amp, which I hope to review here with the MyDac. Available in black or white finishes, its compact 5.5-inch square footprint won't take up much room on your desktop. That's where I auditioned the MyDac, feeding my Emotiva Airmotiv 4 and KEF LS50 speakers. The sound was clean, clear, and still managed to sound nice while streaming music. High-resolution files were better of course; the clarity, soundstage depth, and air were definitely up to audiophile standards. Comparisons with my favorite desktop USB DAC, the $449 Schiit Audio Bifrost ($349 without a USB input), were too close to call. They're both excellent sounding DACs. I couldn't tell them apart -- there were times when I thought one was a tiny bit more transparent than the other, but then I'd flip-flop and prefer the other one. The Micromega MyDac sells for $399.
