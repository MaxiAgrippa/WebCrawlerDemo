Perhaps the biggest surprise was that streaming didn’t dominate the way people expected. Considering Netflix earned a total of 34 nominations in both film and television, its two wins can arguably be seen as a shutout. None of Netflix’s biggest titles, including The Irishman or Two Popes, won any awards. On the acting side, Marriage Story’s Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson, and The Irishman’s Al Pacino and Joe Pesci all lost out to competitors in their respective categories. Even though they lost tonight, there’s always a good chance things will be different at the Oscars next month. “Everyone is watching Netflix,” host Ricky Gervais said at the top of the show. “This show should just be me coming out going: ‘Well done, Netflix. You win everything tonight.’” Considering Netflix earned a total of 34 nominations in both film and television, tonight’s two wins can arguably be seen as a shutout Well, not quite. While Netflix didn’t have the night it might have expected, both Netflix and Amazon Studios did receive a few accolades throughout the night. Laura Dern was awarded Best Supporting Actress for her work in Marriage Story, while Olivia Coleman won Best Actress in a Drama Series for her work in The Crown. Amazon Studios’ Phoebe Waller-Bridge and Fleabag took home multiple awards, following the show’s dominance at last year’s Emmy Awards. The other big streamer of the night, Apple TV Plus, faced a complete shut out for The Morning Show. Hulu, the other big streaming player at the Globes, won two awards. Universal Pictures’ 1917 took home the prize for Best Drama, beating out The Irishman, Marriage Story, Joker, and The Two Popes, while director Sam Mendes beat out favorites like Martin Scorsese and Quentin Tarantino for Best Director. Warner Bros.’ biggest movie of 2019, Joker, picked up a few major wins, including Best Actor for Joaquin Phoenix and Best Score for composer Hildur Gudnadottir. Sony Pictures and Quentin Tarantino’s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood cleaned up: the movie won Best Picture, Comedy or Musical; Quentin Tarantino took home gold for his screenplay; and Brad Pitt won for Best Supporting Actor. Even Rocketman, Elton John’s biopic of sorts, picked up a couple of awards, including a Best Actor win for Taron Egerton. Disney was completely shut out of the animation category On the TV side, HBO saw some big wins. Jeremy Armstrong’s media-loved Succession won the award for Best Drama, and Chernobyl won Best Limited Series. Showtime also saw a win: Russell Crowe received gold for his portrayal of Roger Ailes in Showtime’s The Loudest Voice. Michelle Williams helped FX take home a prize, too, for her performance in Fosse/Verdon. Then there were a few other big surprises. Disney was completely shut out of the animation category, even though it earned three of the five nominations for Toy Story 4, Frozen 2, and The Lion King. Jennifer Lopez lost out for her performance in Hustlers to Laura Dern for the actress’ work in Marriage Story, though both performances were critically acclaimed. Elton John’s original song “I’m Gonna Love Me Again” from Rocketman also beat out Taylor Swift’s original track for Cats, Idina Menzel’s “Into the Unknown” in Frozen 2, and Beyoncé’s “Spirit” in The Lion King.
