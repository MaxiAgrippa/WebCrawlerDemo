Absolutely. Hear experts from Forrester Research and Zurn Industries explain how the value of PIM goes beyond operational efficiencies and share why product content is critical for delivering a great customer experience. Watch the webinar. Hewlett-Packard announced this week that it has signed a new open-source bundling license agreement with Novell to offer customers what it hopes will be simple, cost-effective Linux solutions on HP servers. The offering includes integrated open-source solutions, technical software and proactive service options that are supported and certified on HP ProLiant servers and BladeSystem technologies. Linux Packages With the Enterprise Linux 8-License Value Pack featuring Novell SuSE Linux Enterprise Server 9, HP becomes the only major hardware vendor to offer the same enterprise Linux license packages across one-, two- or four-processor servers. The offering lowers the cost per CPU (central processing unit) regardless of whether those CPUs are single- or dual-core, physical or virtual. A single license is calculated per server rather than per image, meaning a customer can run multiple instances on virtual machines on the same physical server at no additional charge. "In the last six months, HP has fortified its Linux on blade solutions capability with the acquisition of RLX and strong partnership announcements," said Christine Martino, vice president, Open Source and Linux, HP. "Our agreement with Novell ... highlights HP's ability to bring greater choice, confidence and proven integrated solutions to customers looking to combine the flexibility of open source with the performance of HP technology." Single Point of Contact While ideally suited for the HP BladeSystem, the bundle is available across the entire HP ProLiant product line and can be applied on multiple servers as well. A single point of contact is provided for hardware and operating systems,avia which customers can acquire HP Systems Insight Manager software for integrated management and receive virtualization capabilities to meet needs across the data center. "The Enterprise Linux 8-License Value pack from HP and Novell is a compelling new option for customers since it marries premier hardware platforms from HP to the industry's most secure and most scalable Linux operating system, SuSE Linux Enterprise Server," said Hal Bennett, vice president, Global Partners and Programs, Novell. "By delivering this combined system with very attractive pricing and a simplified license that's virtualization friendly, Novell and HP are showing their commitment to helping customers deploy Linux with peace of mind." HP's technical support services are available either with one-year or three-year service contract options. The bundle calls for only one subscription number and one part number for all components.
